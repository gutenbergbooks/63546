<p class="ph1">THE UNDEFEATED</p>

<h2 id="I">I</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was hot.</p>

<p>It was so hot that a certain Mr. William Hollis
sitting on an old bacon box in the lee of a summerhouse
in his lock-up garden had removed coat and
waistcoat tie and collar, rolled up the sleeves of his
shirt and loosened his braces. The presence of a
neighbor&rsquo;s elbows on the party hedge forbade a complete
return to nature, but the freedom of Old Man
Adam from the restraints imposed by society was envied
just now by one at least of his heirs.</p>

<p>By the side of Bill Hollis was a stone jar of Blackhampton
ale, a famous brew, but even this could not
save him from gasping like a carp. It was a scorcher
and no mistake&mdash;thick, slab and hazy, the sort of heat
you can almost cut with a knife.</p>

<p>Leaning gracefully across from the next plot was
a large, rotund gentleman with the face of a well-nourished
ferret. Draped in an artful festoon beneath
an old straw hat, a wreath of burdock leaves
defended him from the weather. &ldquo;Mr. Hollis&rdquo;&mdash;he
addressed the man on the bacon box with conversational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> charm&mdash;&ldquo;if
you want my opinion they&rsquo;re putting
in a bit of overtime in Hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Goldman, you&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo; His neighbor, a man
of somber imagination, was struck by the force of
the image. First he glanced up to a sky of burnished
copper and then he glanced down over the edge of
sheer hillside upon which he and his friend were
poised like a couple of black ants on the face of a hayrick.
Below he saw a cauldron in which seethed more
than a quarter of a million souls. Floating above the
cauldron and its many thousands of chimneys was a
haze of soot thick enough to conceal what in point of
mere size was the fourteenth city of Great Britain.
But speaking geographically, and Blackhampton&rsquo;s inhabitants
were prone to do that, it was the exact center
of England, of the United Kingdom, of the British
Empire, and therefore&mdash;</p>

<p>Somewhere in the mind of William Hollis lurked
a poet, a philosopher and an artist. He pointed over
the dip of the hill into the middle of the cauldron.
&ldquo;Reminds me,&rdquo; he said, half to himself, for he was
not consciously an artist, &ldquo;of the Inferno of Dant,
with Lustrations by Door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Goldman frowned at the simile. What else
could he do? He was a solid citizen, of a solid city,
of a solid empire: he was not merely a Philistine, he
was proud of being a Philistine. He suddenly remembered
that his neighbor was a failure as a man of
business. And in a flash Mr. Goldman knew why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Hollis&mdash;hot.&rdquo; The ferret-faced gentleman
spoke with more caution and less charm. Commercially
and socially he was secure, but the same could
hardly be said for the man on the bacon box who
spoke of the Inferno of Dant with Lustrations by
Door&mdash;whatever the Inferno of Dant with Lustrations
by Door might be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hot enough, Mr. Goldman, to melt those three
brass balls of yours.&rdquo; It was a graceful allusion to a
trade symbol, yet a prosperous pawnbroker felt that
in making it a semi-bankrupt greengrocer was verging
upon the familiar. He had just reached that conclusion
when a boy selling papers came along the narrow
lane that ran past the end of the garden, and
thrust a tousled head over the fence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four o&rsquo;clock, mister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bill Hollis produced a halfpenny. A minute later
he produced a note of disgust. &ldquo;County&rsquo;s beat. Yorkshire
won by an innings an&rsquo; four runs. Funny thing,
our chaps can&rsquo;t never play against Yorkshire&mdash;not
for sour apples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Goldman gave a slow deep grunt and then artistically
readjusted his garland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hirst six for twenty-two. Them Tykes can <i>bahl</i>
a bit. Rhodes four for nineteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Goldman grunted again. And it was now clear
by the look in his small eyes that disapproval was intended.
The Inferno of Dant with Lustrations by
Door was still in his mind. That was the key to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>neighbor&rsquo;s financial failure, but this squandering of
money, time and brain power on things of no value
was just as significant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cricket.&rdquo; The tone was very scornful. &ldquo;One o&rsquo;
these days cricket is going to be the ruin of the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William Hollis stoutly dissented. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cricket that
makes us what we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s business, Hollis, that makes a country.&rdquo; There
was an accession of moral superiority in the pawnbroker&rsquo;s
tone. &rdquo;That&rsquo;s the thing that counts. All this
sport is ruination&mdash;ruination, Hollis&mdash;the road to nowhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William Hollis was unconvinced, but a man so successful
had him at a hopeless disadvantage. In theory
he was sure that he was right, but the pawnbroker
knew that he had just made a composition with
his creditors, so that it didn&rsquo;t matter how sound the
argument or how honest the cause, he was out of
court. Truth doesn&rsquo;t matter. It is public opinion that
matters. And public opinion is conditioned by many
subtleties, among which a banking account is foremost.</p>

<p>Bill Hollis covered his retreat from a position that
should have been impregnable, by turning to another
part of the paper which was the Blackhampton <i>Evening
Star</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ultimatum to Serbia. Ugly situation. I don&rsquo;t
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Goldman asked why he didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dodge to sell the paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said the pawnbroker judicially.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve always got some flam or other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Civil war in Ireland,&rdquo; announced Bill Hollis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay. And next week we shall have the sea
serpent and the giant gooseberry. And all for a halfpenny,
mark you. We&rsquo;re living in great days, Hollis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little greengrocer was silent a moment and then
he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;I sometimes think, Mr. Goldman,
what this country wants is a really good war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Goldman smiled in a superior way. &ldquo;Well, I
don&rsquo;t mind telling you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve thought
that for the last twenty years. Not this country only,
but Europe, the whole world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Mr. Goldman.&rdquo; There was a grandeur
in the conception that in spite of the weather
almost moved his neighbor to enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stands to reason, my boy, and I&rsquo;ll tell you why.
The world is overpoppylated. Look at this town of
ours.&rdquo; With the finger of an Olympian the pawnbroker
pointed down the hillside to the smoking cauldron
below. &ldquo;Poppylation two hundred and sixty odd
thousand at the last census. And when I first set up
in business, the year before the Franco-Prussian War,
it was seventy-two thousand. And it&rsquo;s not only here,
it&rsquo;s all over the world alike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is so, Mr. Goldman. And they say that in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>America it&rsquo;s even worse. In fact, wherever you look
the competition is cruel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Hollis, a real good war would do a power of
good. We want Old Boney back again&mdash;then there
might be breathing space for a bit. As it is this country
is overrun with aliens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William assented gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This town of ours, my boy, is crawling with Germans.
They come over here and take the bread out
of our mouths. They work for nothing and they live
on nothing. They learn all our trades and then they
go back to the Fatherland, and undersell us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Said Bill Hollis with the air of a prophet, &ldquo;I reckon
that sooner or later we&rsquo;ll be having a scrap with the
Germans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not likely.&rdquo; The pawnbroker&rsquo;s tone was a little
contemptuous. &ldquo;The Germans can get all they want
without fighting. Peaceful penetration&rsquo;s their game.
They are the cleverest nation in the world. In another
twenty years they&rsquo;ll own it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this last expression of his wisdom Mr. Goldman
gave a final touch to his straw hat and its cool
garland, waddled down a box-bordered path and out
of the gate at the bottom of his garden.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="II">II</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE departure of Mr. Goldman left a void in
the heart of Mr. William Hollis. He was a
sociable man, with a craving for the company of his
fellows, and although for quite a long time now his
distinguished neighbor had been clearly labeled in his
mind as &ldquo;a pursy old pig,&rdquo; he was an interesting person
to talk to when he was in the humor. He was
not always in the humor, it was true, for he was a
&ldquo;warm&rdquo; man, an owner of house property; therefore
he was in the happy position of not having to be civil
to anybody when he didn&rsquo;t feel like it. This afternoon,
however, he had unbent.</p>

<p>The slowly receding form of Mr. Goldman waddled
along by the hedge, turned into the lane, passed from
view. In almost the same moment William Hollis
felt a severe depression. He had reached the stage
of life and fortune when he could not bear to be alone.
With a kind of dull pain he realized that this was his
forty-first birthday and that he had failed in life.</p>

<p>He was going down the hill. Unless he could take
a pull on himself he was done. Already it might be
too late. The best part of his life was behind him.
A year ago that day, in this very garden, his only
source of happiness, he had told himself that; two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>years ago, three years ago, five years ago, this had
been the burden of his thoughts. But he was in a rut
and there seemed to be no way out.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago he had felt it was in him to do
something. He was an ambitious young fellow with
a mind that looked forward to the day after to-morrow.
Such a man ought to have done something. But
now he knew that there had been a soft spot in him
somewhere and that a moral and mental dry rot had
already set in. He was a talker, a thinker, a dreamer;
action was not his sphere. Unless he took a strong
pull on himself he was out of the race.</p>

<p>He poured what remained of the jar of ale into the
earthenware mug he kept for the purpose&mdash;Blackhampton
ale tastes better out of a mug&mdash;and drank it
slowly, without relish. Then he cut a few flowers to
take home to his wife&mdash;to the wife who hadn&rsquo;t spoken
to him for nearly a week&mdash;arranged them in a bunch,
with the delicacy of one unconsciously sensitive to
form and color, looped a bit of twitch neatly round
them, put on his coat, a stained and worn alpaca, put
on his hat, a battered, disreputable straw, cast the
eye of a lover round his precious garden, locked its
dilapidated green door and started down the lane and
down the hill towards the city.</p>

<p>It was now five o&rsquo;clock and a little cooler, yet William
Hollis walked very slowly. There was a lot of
time to kill before the day was through. But his
thoughts were biting him harder than ever as he turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>into the famous road leading to the city, known as
The Rise. This salubrious eminence, commanding the
town from the northeast, was sacred to the city magnates.
When a man made good in Blackhampton,
really good, he built a house on The Rise. It was
the ambition of every true Blackhamptonian to express
his individuality in that way. Until he had
achieved a house entirely to his own fancy and taste
on The Rise, no son of Blackhampton could be said
really to have &ldquo;arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William Hollis trudged slowly along a well kept
road, between two irregular lines of superb villas,
gleaming with paint and glass, standing well back
from the road in ample grounds of their own, with
broad and trim gravel approaches. The first on the
right was Rosemere, the residence of Sir Reuben Jope,
three times Mayor of Blackhampton, a man of large
fortune and robust taste, whose last expression was
greenhouses and conservatories. They were said to
produce fabulous things&mdash;flowers, fruits, shrubs,
plants known only to tropical countries. Many a time
from afar had Bill gazed upon them with rather wistful
awe.</p>

<p>A little farther along was The Haven, the ancestral
home of the Clints, a famous Blackhampton family
whose local prestige was on a par with that of
the Rothschilds in the city of London. Across the
road was The Gables, the modest house of Lawyer
Mossop, the town&rsquo;s leading solicitor; then on the right,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>again, the reticulated dwelling of the philanthropic
Stephen Mortimore, head of the great engineering
firm of Mortimore, Barrow, and Mortimore. For a
true son of Blackhampton these were names to conjure
with. Even to walk along such a road gave one
a feeling of worldly success, financial security, aristocratic
exclusiveness.</p>

<p>Still a little further along on the left was what was
clearly intended to be the <i>pièce de resistance</i> of The
Rise. It was the brand-new residence of the very latest
arrival and no house had been more discussed by
Blackhampton society. It was intended to eclipse
every other dwelling on The Rise, but it was of nondescript
design, half suburban villa, half mediæval
castle. From the æsthetic standpoint the result was
so little satisfactory that a local wit had christened it
&ldquo;Dammit &rsquo;All.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As &ldquo;Dammit &rsquo;All&rdquo; came into view, Bill Hollis found
an almost morbid fascination in gazing at its turrets
and the tower so regally crowning them. It was the
house of his father-in-law, Mr. Josiah Munt. Sixteen
years ago, in that very month of July, an ambitious
young man had married his master&rsquo;s eldest daughter.
Melia Munt had espoused Bill Hollis in direct defiance
of her father&rsquo;s wishes and had lived long enough already
to rue the day. Josiah, at that time, was not the
great man he had since become, but he was a hard,
unbending parent; and he gave Melia to understand
clearly that if she married Hollis he would never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>speak to her again. Melia chose to defy him, as he
always thought out of sheer perversity, and her implacable
father had been careful to keep his word to
the letter. Not again did he mention her name; not
again did her old home receive her.</p>

<p>In those sixteen years Josiah Munt had gone up
in the world, and if William Hollis could not be said
to have come down in it, he had certainly made very
little headway. At the time of his marriage he was
the chief barman at &ldquo;the Duke of Wellington,&rdquo; an
extremely thriving public house, at the corner of
Waterloo Square in the populous southeastern part
of the city. He was now a small greengrocer in Love
Lane, within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the famous licensed
house of his father-in-law, and he was continually
haunted by the problem of how much longer he would
be able to carry on his business. On the other hand,
his old master had prospered so much that he had recently
built for himself a fine house on The Rise.</p>

<p>Mr. Josiah Munt was still the owner of the Duke
of Wellington. Over the top of its swing doors his
name appeared below the spirited effigy of the Iron
Duke as &ldquo;licensed to sell wines, spirits, beer and tobacco,&rdquo;
but years ago he had ceased to reside there
with his family. As far as possible he liked to disassociate
himself from it in the public mind, but he
was too shrewd a man to part with the goose that laid
the golden eggs; besides, in his heart, there was a
tender spot for the old house which had been the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>foundation of his fortunes. His womenfolk might
despise it; in some ways he had outgrown it himself;
but he knew better than to crab his luck by parting
with an extremely valuable property which at the
present time was not appreciated at its true worth by
the surveyor of rates and taxes.</p>

<p>As William Hollis trudged along the dusty road
and his father-in-law&rsquo;s new and amazing house came
into view, he became the prey of many emotions. The
sight of this magnificence was a bitter pill to swallow.
It brought back vividly to his mind the scene that was
printed on it forever&mdash;the scene that followed his diffident
request for the hand of Melia. He could still
hear the stinging taunts of his employer, he could still
feel the impact of Josiah&rsquo;s boot. It may have been
that boot&mdash;for women are queer!&mdash;which caused the
final capitulation of Melia. But the hard part was that
time had justified the prediction of her far-sighted
parent. Melia in throwing herself away on &ldquo;a man
of no class&rdquo; would do a bad day&rsquo;s work when she
married Hollis.</p>

<p>It had been the son-in-law&rsquo;s intention to give the lie
to that prophecy. But!&mdash;there was a kink in him
somewhere. He had always loved to dream of the
future, yet he had not the power of making his dreams
come true. If only he had had a good education! If
only he had known people who could have put him
on the right road to success when he was young and
sharp and the sap was in his brain! If only there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>hadn&rsquo;t been so much competition, so much to fight
against; if only he could have had a bit of luck; if
only Melia had really cared for him; if only he hadn&rsquo;t
speculated with the hundred pounds she had inherited
from her Aunt Elizabeth; if only he wasn&rsquo;t so apt to
be hurt by things that didn&rsquo;t matter a damn!</p>

<p>William Hollis was a disappointed and embittered
man. Life had gone wrong with him; but a small jar
of Blackhampton Old Ale softens failure and evokes
the quality of self-pity. However, as he approached
Mr. Munt&rsquo;s gate and gained a clearer view of the newest
and most imposing house on The Rise, the sense
of failure rose in him to a pitch that was hard to
bear. So this was what Melia&rsquo;s father had done!
No wonder she despised a man like himself. It was
not very surprising after all that she hardly threw a
word to him now from one day&rsquo;s end to another.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="III">III</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span> MAN in an apron that had once been white and
in a cloth cap that had once been navy blue
was painting a series of bold letters on Mr. Josiah
Munt&rsquo;s front gate. Bill Hollis was overwhelmed with
depression, but at this interesting sight curiosity
stirred him. He advanced upon the decorative artist
who was whistling gently over a job in which he took
a pride and a pleasure. Upon the ornate front of the
large green gate was being inscribed the word</p>

<p class="center no-indent">
STRATHFIELDSAYE</p>

<p>Bill recognized the artist as a near neighbor of his
own in Love Lane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Working for the Nobs, are you, Wickens?&rdquo;
There was a world of scorn in the tone of William
Hollis, a world of sarcasm. And yet what was scorn
and what was sarcasm in the presence of a hard fact,
clear, outstanding, fully accomplished!</p>

<p>The artist expectorated a silent affirmative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Piecework, I suppose? Cut rates?&rdquo; Mr. Munt
had the reputation of being a very keen man of business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The artist was too much absorbed in his labors to
indulge in promiscuous talk.</p>

<p>William Hollis peered through the gate, to the rows
of newly planted shrubs on either side the curving
carriage drive. &ldquo;Bleeding upstart&rdquo; he muttered;
then he turned on his heel and walked on up the road.</p>

<p>He had gone but a few yards when quite unexpectedly
he came upon a massive figure in a black
and white checked summer suit and a white billycock
hat worn at a rather rakish angle. It was his
father-in-law and they were face to face.</p>

<p>Mr. Munt was proceeding with a kind of elephantine
dignity along the exact center of the sidewalk,
and instinctively, before he was aware of what he had
done, his son-in-law by stepping nimbly into the
grassgrown gutter had conceded it to him. But in
almost the same instant he scorned himself for his
action; and the gesture of lordly indifference with
which the proprietor of the Duke of Wellington directed
his gaze upon the western gables of Strathfieldsaye,
without a flicker of recognition of the person
who had made way for him, suddenly brought William
Hollis to the bursting point.</p>

<p>The world allows that in a stone jar of Blackhampton
Old Ale there are magic qualities; and far down
in Bill himself was hidden some deep strain of independent
manhood. The City records proved&mdash;vide
Bazeley&rsquo;s famous Annals of Blackhampton, a second-hand
copy of which was one of his most cherished pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>sessions&mdash;that
the name of Hollis had been known
and honored in the town long before the name of
Munt had been heard of. The Hollises were an old
and distinguished Blackhampton clan. A William
Hollis was mayor of the Borough in the year of the
Armada. It was a family of wide ramifications.
There was the great John Hollis the inventor, circa
1724-1798, there was Henry Hollis the poet, circa
1747-1801. Of these their present descendant was a
kinsman so remote that the science of genealogy had
lost track of their actual relationship. But beyond
a doubt his father&rsquo;s uncle, Troop Sergeant Major
William Hollis, had fought at Waterloo. He himself
was named after that worthy, and the old boy&rsquo;s portrait
and portions of his kit had long embellished the
sitting room in Love Lane.</p>

<p>It was then, perhaps, force of ancestry quite as
much as the virtue of the Blackhampton ale that
moved William Hollis to his sudden and remarkable
act of self-assertion. For as Josiah Munt passed him,
head in air, and weather eye fixed upon the western
gables of Strathfieldsaye, his son-in-law stopped,
swung round and called after him in a voice that
could be heard even by the decorative artist at work
on the gate&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sally out of Quod yet?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="IV">IV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>Y not so much as the quiver of an eyelid did Mr.
Munt betray that he had even heard, much less
taken cognizance, of that which amounted to a studied
insult on the part of William Hollis. The proprietor
of the Duke of Wellington converged upon the
gate of Strathfieldsaye with head upheld, with dignity
unimpaired. He even cast one cool glance at the
handiwork of the inspired Wickens, but made no comment
upon it, while the artist suspended his labors,
opened the gate obsequiously, and waited for the
great man to pass through. But when Mr. Munt had
walked along the carriage drive to within a few yards
of his newly bedizened front door, he stopped all of a
sudden like a man who has received a blow in the face.</p>

<p>Had Bill Hollis at that moment been able to obtain
a glimpse of his father-in-law he would have seen
that his shaft had gone right home. A sternly domineering
countenance was distorted with passion.
There was a rage of suffering in the fierce yellow-brown
eyes, there was a twist of half strangled torment
in the lines of the hard mouth. As the lord of
Strathfieldsaye stood clenching his hands in the center
of the gravel he was not an attractive figure. Before
entering the house he took off the white hat and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>soothed the pressure upon head and neck by passing
over them a red bandanna handkerchief.</p>

<p>A trim parlor maid, bright as a new pin, received
the lord of Strathfieldsaye. The smart and shining
creature was in harmony with her surroundings.
Everything in the spacious and lofty entrance hall
shone with paint and polish, with new curtains, new
carpets, new fittings, new furniture.</p>

<p>Mr. Munt handed his hat to the parlor maid rather
roughly. &ldquo;Tea&rsquo;s in the drawing-room, sir,&rdquo; she said,
calmly and modestly. It was the air of a very superior
servant.</p>

<p>Josiah went into the drawing-room and found two
ladies drinking tea and consuming cake, strawberries
and cream and bread and butter. One was a depressed
lady in puce silk to whom her lord paid little attention;
the other was much more sprightly, although by
no means in the first blush of youth. She had the
air of a visitor.</p>

<p>Before heralding his arrival by any remark, Mr.
Munt gazed with an air of genuine satisfaction round
the large cool room smelling of paint and general
newness, and then he said in a tone of rather grim
heartiness to the more sprightly of the two ladies,
&ldquo;Well, Gert, what do you think on us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a careful marshaling of manner on the
part of the lady addressed as Gert. &ldquo;Almost <i>too</i>
grand, Josiah&mdash;since you ask my opinion. Still I&rsquo;ve
been telling Maria that she must show Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The nod of Josiah might be said to express approval.
Miss Gertrude Preston was a half-sister of
his wife, and she was perhaps the only woman among
his strictly limited acquaintance who was able to sustain
a claim to his respect. She had character and
great common sense and having acted for many years
as resident companion to no less a person than Lawyer
Mossop&rsquo;s aunt, the late Miss Selina Gregg, she
had seen something of the world. Upon all subjects
her views were well considered and uncommonly
shrewd; therefore they were not to be passed over
lightly. Aunt Gerty was a favorite of Josiah, not
merely for the reason that &ldquo;she knew a bit more than
most,&rdquo; but also because she was clever enough to play
up to his rising fortunes and growing renown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maria shown you round?&rdquo; said Josiah, accepting
a cup of tea from the graceful hands of his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>The depressed lady in puce silk sighed a limp yes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eggshell china tea service,&rdquo; Gerty fixed a purposeful
eye upon Josiah&rsquo;s cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of old Nickerson&rsquo;s sale,&rdquo; Josiah performed
an audible act of deglutition. &ldquo;Four pun ten the set.
Slop basin&rsquo;s cracked though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see it is, but you have a bargain, Josiah. You
always seem to have a bargain, no matter what you
buy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah purred under the subtle flattery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seen that chayney vawse?&rdquo; He pointed across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>room to a pedestal upon which was a blue china bowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like genuine Ming,&rdquo; Gertrude opened a
pair of long-handled tortoiseshell glasses. There was
less than a score of ladies in the whole of Blackhampton
who sported glasses of that ultra-fashionable kind,
but Miss Preston was one of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That young feller Parish said it was genuine and
he ought to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charming,&rdquo; Gerty sighed effectively; then her eyes
went slowly round the room. &ldquo;This room is perfect.
And such a view. You stand so high that you can
look right over the city without knowing that it&rsquo;s
there. And there&rsquo;s the Sharrow beyond. Isn&rsquo;t that
Corfield Weir on the right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rather proudly Josiah said that it was Corfield
Weir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that great bank of trees going up into the
sky must be Dibley Chase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dibley right enough,&rdquo; vouched Josiah. &ldquo;Have
you had a look from the tower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have. Wonderful. Maria says on a clear
day you can see Cliveden Castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye. And a sight farther than that. You can
see three counties up there. To my mind, Gert, this
house stands on the plumb bit of The Rise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gertrude fully agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it ought if it comes to that. I had to pay seven
and sixpence a yard for the land, before I could put
a brick on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Gertrude was impressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think o&rsquo; that oak paneling in the dining-room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought it was charming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Maria shown you the greenus&mdash;I should say
conservatory&mdash;an&rsquo; the rockery&mdash;an&rsquo; the motor garidge?
We haven&rsquo;t got the motor yet, but it&rsquo;s coming
next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gertrude had seen these things. It only remained
for her to enter upon a diplomatic rapture at the recital
of their merits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No strawberries, thank you,&rdquo; Josiah&rsquo;s voice was
rather sharp as the depressed lady tactlessly offered
these delicacies at a moment when her lord was fully
engaged in describing the unparalleled difficulties he
had had to surmount in order to get the water fountain
beyond the tennis lawn to work properly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fact o&rsquo; the matter is, our Water Board wants
wackenin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you are the man to do that, Josiah. You
are an alderman now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; The slight note of inflation was unconscious.
&ldquo;And old Scrimshire an&rsquo; that pettifoggin&rsquo;
crew are goin&rsquo; to have a word in season from Alderman
Munt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t get yourself disliked though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah smiled sourly. &ldquo;Gel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a man worth
his salt is never afraid o&rsquo; being unpopular. Right is
right an&rsquo; wrong is no man&rsquo;s right. Our Water Board&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>got to be run on new lines. It&rsquo;s a disgrace to the
city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Preston was far too wise to offer an opinion
upon that matter. She knew, none better, the limits
imposed by affairs upon the sex to which she belonged.
But she was very shrewd and perceptive and underneath
the subtle flatteries she dealt out habitually to
this brother-in-law of hers was a genuine respect for
great abilities and his terrific force of character.</p>

<p>Among all the outstanding figures in Blackhampton
his was perhaps the least attractive. His name, in
polite circles, was almost a byword, for he never
studied the feelings of anybody; he deferred only to
his own will and invariably took the shortest way to
enforce it. There was generally a covert laugh or
a covert sneer at the mention of his name and the
house he had recently built on The Rise had set a
seal upon his unpopularity. Nevertheless, the people
who knew him best respected him most. His sister-in-law
knew him very well indeed.</p>

<p>Maria poured out a second cup of tea rather nervously
for Josiah to whom Miss Preston handed it
archly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No cake, thanks. I dussent.&rdquo; He tapped his chest
significantly; then he cast a complacent glance through
the wide-flung drawing-room windows to the fair
pleasaunce beyond. &ldquo;So you think, Gert, take it altogether,
this is a cut above Waterloo Villa, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Gertrude&rsquo;s only answer to such a question was a
discreet laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waterloo Villa was <i>so</i> comfortable,&rdquo; sighed the
depressed lady in puce silk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no comparison, Maria, really no comparison.&rdquo;
It was wonderful how the caressing touch
of the woman of the world dispersed the cloud upon
Josiah&rsquo;s brow almost before it had time to gather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course there isn&rsquo;t, Gerty. Any one with a grain
o&rsquo; sense knows that. Why, only this morning as I
went down in the tram with Lawyer Mossop, he said,
&lsquo;Mr. Munt, this new house of yours is quite the pick
of the basket.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, Josiah.&rdquo; The discreet voice rose to enthusiasm.
&ldquo;And no one knows that better than Maria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady in puce silk gave a little sigh and a little
sniff. &ldquo;Waterloo Villa was quite good enough for
<i>me</i>,&rdquo; she murmured tactlessly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="V">V</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was silence for a moment and then said
Josiah: &ldquo;Talking of Lawyer Mossop&mdash;that reminds
me. I&rsquo;m going round to see him. I wonder
what time he gets back from his office.&rdquo; He looked
at his watch. &ldquo;Quarter past five. Bit too soon, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria ventured to ask what he wanted Lawyer
Mossop for.</p>

<p>Josiah did not answer the question immediately.
When he did answer it his voice had such a depth
of emotion that both ladies felt as if a knife had
been plunged suddenly into their flesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to take our Sally out of my will.&rdquo; There
was something almost terrible in the sternness and
finality of the words.</p>

<p>The depressed lady in puce silk gave a gasp. A
moment afterwards large tears began to drip freely
from her eyes.</p>

<p>Aunt Gerty sat very upright on a satinwood chair,
her hands folded in front of her, and two prominent
teeth showing beyond a line of extremely firm lips.
She didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice thing&rdquo;&mdash;each word was slowly distilled
from a feeling of outrage that was almost unbear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>able&mdash;&ldquo;to
be made the talk and the mark of the
whole city. And after what I&rsquo;ve done for that gel!
School&mdash;college&mdash;France&mdash;Germany&mdash;your advice,
you know, Gerty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Gerty didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then she comes home and gets herself six
weeks&rsquo; hard labor. Hard labor, mark you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both ladies shivered audibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice thing for a man who has always kept himself
up, to have his daughter pitchin&rsquo; brick ends
through the windows of the Houses o&rsquo; Parliament, to
say nothin&rsquo; of assaulting the police. Gerty, that comes
of higher education.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still Aunt Gerty didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fact is, women ain&rsquo;t ripe for higher education.
It goes to their heads. But I&rsquo;ll let her see. In a few
minutes I&rsquo;ll be off round to Lawyer Mossop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;Josiah!&rdquo; ventured a quavering voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word, Mother. My mind&rsquo;s made up. That
gel has fairly made the name o&rsquo; Munt stink in the
nostrils of the nation. Not ten minutes ago that
rotten little dog Bill Hollis flung it in my teeth as I
came in at the front gate. The little wastrel happened
to be passing and he called after me, &lsquo;Sally out
of Quod yet?&rsquo; One o&rsquo; these days I&rsquo;ll quod him&mdash;the
little skunk&mdash;or Josiah Munt J.P. is not my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria continued to weep copiously but in silence.
She dare not make her grief vocal with the stern eye
of her husband upon her. The tragedy of her eldest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>girl&rsquo;s defiance, now sixteen years old, was still green
in her memory. Josiah had given Amelia plainly to
understand that if she married William Hollis he
would never speak to her again and he had kept his
word. Maria had not got over it even yet; and now
their youngest girl, Sally, on whose upbringing a fabulous
sum had been lavished, had disgraced them in
the sight of everybody.</p>

<p>Josiah was meting out justice no doubt, but mothers
are apt to be irrational where their offspring are
concerned; and had Maria been able to muster the
courage she would have broken a lance with him, even
now, in this matter of the youngest girl. But she was
afraid of him. And she knew he was in the right.
Sally&rsquo;s name had appeared in all the papers. That
morning, by a cruel stroke, they had come out with
her portrait&mdash;Miss Sarah Ann Munt, youngest daughter
of Alderman Munt J.P. of Blackhampton, sentenced
to six weeks hard labor. Yes, it was cruel!
It would take her father a long time to get over it.
And for Maria herself, it was like the loss in infancy
of the young Josiah; it was a thing she would
always remember but never quite be able to grasp.</p>

<p>The silence grew intolerable. At last it was broken
by Gertrude Preston.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be having splendid roses, Josiah&mdash;next
year.&rdquo; Those mincing tones, quite cool and untroubled,
somehow did wonders. Josiah had always been
a noted rose grower and as his sister-in-law pointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>elegantly to the rows of young bushes beyond the
drawing-room windows something in him began to
respond. After all that was his great asset as a
human entity: the power to react strongly and readily
to the many things in which he was interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he said, almost gratefully. &ldquo;Next year
they&rsquo;ll be a sight. I&rsquo;ve had a double course o&rsquo; manure
put down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;ll be some of my favorite Gloire de
Dijons,&rdquo; said Gerty with fervor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet there will be. There&rsquo;s a dozen bushes
over yond. By the way, Gert, you&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; to the
show to-morrow week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Preston, for all her enthusiasm for roses, was
not sure that she could get to the show. But Josiah
informed her that she would <i>have</i> to come. And he
enforced his command by taking a leather case from
his breast pocket and producing a small blue card
on which was printed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
BLACKHAMPTON AND DISTRICT ROSE GROWERS&rsquo; ASSOCIATION<br />
<br />
PRESIDENT, ALDERMAN JOSIAH MUNT J.P.</p>

<p>The twenty-seventh annual Show will be held in the Jubilee
Park on Tuesday, August the Fourth. Prizes will be presented
at six o&rsquo;clock to successful competitors by Mrs. Alderman Munt.
The Blackhampton Prize Brass Band will be in attendance.
Dancing in the evening, weather permitting.</p>

<p>Admission one shilling.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll get you in, Gert.&rdquo; The card was placed in
her hand. &ldquo;Come and stand by Maria and keep her
up to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Had Maria dared she would have groaned dismally.
As it was she had to be content with a slight gesture
of dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see it&rsquo;ll be a bit o&lsquo; practice for her. In 1916&mdash;the
year after next&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be the Mayoress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady in puce silk shuddered audibly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="VI">VI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the process of time the clock on the drawing-room
chimneypiece chimed six and Josiah &ldquo;stepped
round&rdquo; to Lawyer Mossop&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>That celebrity lived at The Gables, the next house
but one along The Rise. Outwardly a more modest
dwelling than Strathfieldsaye, it was less modern in
style, more reticent, more compact. As Josiah walked
up the drive he noted with approval its well kept appearance
and its fine display of rhododendrons, phlox,
delphiniums, purple irises and many other things that
spoke to him. He was a genuine lover of flowers.</p>

<p>Mr. Munt&rsquo;s pressure of the electric button was answered
by a manservant in a starched shirt and a neat
black cutaway. The visitor noted him carefully as
he noted everything. &ldquo;I wonder what he pays a month
for that jockey!&rdquo; was the form the memorandum took
on the tablets of his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mossop in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll come this way I&rsquo;ll inquire, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah was led across a square-tiled hall, covered
in the center by a Persian rug, into a room delightfully
cool, with a large window in a western angle opening
on to a pergola ablaze with roses, along which the
westering sun streamed amazingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What name, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; Josiah frowned. As if there was a man,
woman or child in Blackhampton who didn&rsquo;t know
him! Still, it was good style. &ldquo;Munt&mdash;Mr. Munt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir!&rdquo; The manservant bowed and
withdrew.</p>

<p>Yes, it was good style. And this cool, clean but
rather somber room had the same elusive quality.
Three of its four walls were covered with neat rows
of books, for the most part in expensive bindings.
Style again. All the same the visitor looked a little
doubtfully upon those shining shelves. Books were
not in his line, and although he did not go quite to
the length of despising them he was well content that
they shouldn&rsquo;t be. Books stood for education, and in
the purview of Mr. Josiah Munt, &ldquo;if they didn&rsquo;t watch
it education was going to be the ruin of the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still to that room, plainly but richly furnished, those
rows of shining leather lent a tone, a value. A shrewd eye ran them up and down.
Meredith&mdash;Swinburne&mdash;Tennyson&mdash;Browning&mdash;Dickens&mdash;Thackeray&mdash;all
flams, of course, but harmless, if not carried too far.
Personally he preferred a good billiard room, but no
one in Blackhampton disputed that Lawyer Mossop
was the absolute head of his profession; he could be
trusted therefore to know what he was doing. There
was one of these books open on a very good table&mdash;forty
guineas worth of anybody&rsquo;s money&mdash;printed in
a foreign language, French probably, of which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>couldn&lsquo;t read a word. Il Purgatorio, Dante. Fine bit
of printing. Wonderful paper! Yes, wonderful! He
handled it appraisingly. And then he realized that
Lawyer Mossop was in the room and smiling at him
in that polite way, that was half soft sawder, half
good feeling. The carpet was so thick that he had
not heard him come in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Munt.&rdquo; The greeting was very
friendly and pleasant. &ldquo;Sit down, won&lsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll stand&mdash;and grow better.&ldquo; Mr. Munt had
a stock of stereotyped pleasantries which he kept for
social use. They seemed to make for ease and geniality.</p>

<p>The two men stood looking at each other, the solicitor
all rounded corners and quiet ease, the client stiff,
angular, assertive, perhaps a shade embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything I can do for you, Mr. Munt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer was slow in coming. It was embodied
in a harsh growl. &ldquo;Mossop, I want you to take that
gel of mine, Sally, out of my will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer said nothing, but pursed his lips a little,
a way he had when setting the mind to work, but that
was the only expression of visible feeling in the heavily
lined face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse my troubling you to-night, Mossop. But
I felt I couldn&rsquo;t wait. Give me an appointment for
the morning and I&rsquo;ll look in at the office. Nice goings
on! And to think what her education cost me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer made a silent gesture, spreading his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>hands like a stage Frenchman, half dismay, half tacit
protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better have a new document, eh?&rdquo; The outraged
parent had been already dismissed; the highly competent
man of affairs was now in control. &ldquo;My second
girl, Ethel, Mrs. Doctor Cockburn, can have it all now,
except&rdquo;&mdash;Josiah hesitated an instant&mdash;&ldquo;except five
thousand pounds I shall leave to Gertrude Preston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lawyer Mossop was still silent. But the mobile
lips were working curiously. &ldquo;Not for me to advise,&rdquo;
he said at last, very slowly, with much hesitation, &ldquo;but
if I might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah cut him short with a stern lift of the hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re going to say, but if she was
your gel what&rsquo;d you do, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lawyer Mossop rubbed his cheek perplexedly. &ldquo;At
bottom I might be rather proud of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;might&mdash;be&mdash;rather&mdash;proud&mdash;of&mdash;her!&rdquo; It
was the tone of Alderman Munt J.P. to a particularly
unsatisfactory witness at a morning session at the City
Hall. An obvious lie, yet a white one because it was
used for a moral purpose. Mossop had no ax to
grind; he merely wanted to soften things a bit for a
client and neighbor. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i>, Mossop, you
really think <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The solicitor gazed steadily past the purple face of
his client through the open window to the riot of color
beyond. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Think of the pluck
required to do a thing like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Josiah shook his head angrily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the devil that&rsquo;s
in her.&rdquo; He spoke with absolute conviction. &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s always been there. When she was that high&rdquo;&mdash;he
made an indication with his hand&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fair lammoxed
her, but I could never turn her an inch. If she
wanted to do a thing she&lsquo;d do it&mdash;and if she didn&rsquo;t
nothing would make her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lady of strong character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cussedness, my friend, cussedness. The devil.
And it&rsquo;s brought her to this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer, however, shook his head gently. &ldquo;Well,
Mr. Munt, as I say, it is not for me to advise, but if
she was a daughter of mine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be proud of her.&rdquo; The sneer was rather
ugly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a way&mdash;yes&mdash;perhaps ... I don&rsquo;t say positively ... because
one quite sees.... On the other
hand, I might ... I don&rsquo;t say I should ... I <i>might</i>
be just as angry as you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thundercloud began to lift a little. &ldquo;Come now,
that&lsquo;s sense. Of course, Mossop, you&lsquo;d be as mad as
anybody&mdash;it&lsquo;s human nature. Every Tom, Dick, and
Harry pointin&lsquo; the finger of scorn&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Sally out of Quod
yet</i> was still searing him like a flame&mdash;&ldquo;you&lsquo;d be so
mad, Mossop, that you&rsquo;d want to forget that she belonged
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be so.&rdquo; Mr. Mossop&rsquo;s far-looking eyes
were still fixed on the pergola. &ldquo;At the same time,
before I took any definite step, I think I should give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>myself a clear fortnight in which to think it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah laughed harshly. &ldquo;No, Mossop&mdash;not if you
were as mad as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was so true that the solicitor was not able to
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I think on her&rdquo;&mdash;the great veins began to
swell in the head and neck of the lord of Strathfieldsaye&mdash;&ldquo;I
feel as if I&rsquo;d like to kill her. Did you see that
picture in the <i>Morning Mirror</i>? And that paragraph
in the <i>Mail</i>? It&rsquo;s horrible, Mossop, horrible. And
first and last her education&lsquo;s cost me every penny of
three thousand pound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mossop nodded appreciatively; then, sympathetically,
he lifted the lid of a silver box on a charming
walnut-wood stand and asked his visitor to have
a cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I never smoke before my dinner,&rdquo; said Josiah
sternly. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t been home a month from
Germany.&rdquo; The veins in his forehead grew even more
distended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;in Germany?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight months at Dresden. Pity she didn&rsquo;t stop
there. Fact o&lsquo; the matter is she&rsquo;s over-educated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer looked a little dubious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mossop. Not having a boy, I don&rsquo;t mind
tellin&lsquo; you I&rsquo;ve been a bit too ambitious for that gel.
And over-education is what this country is suffering
from at the present time. It&rsquo;s the national disease.
And women take it worse than men. School&mdash;college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>&mdash;Paris&mdash;and
Germany on the top of &rsquo;em. I must
have been mad. However ... there it is! ... let
me know when the document&rsquo;s ready and I&rsquo;ll look in
at the office and sign it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer would have liked to continue his protest
but the face of his client forbade. He crossed to his
writing table, took up a pencil and a sheet of notepaper
and said, &ldquo;Miss Sarah&lsquo;s portion to Mrs. Cockburn
except&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five thousand pounds to Gertrude Preston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer made a brief note. &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he said
gravely. &ldquo;I hope a codicil will be sufficient; we&rsquo;ll avoid
a new instrument, if we can. You shall know when
it&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah gave a curt nod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to be war in Europe, do you think?&rdquo; said
the solicitor in a lighter, more conversational tone.
It was merely to relieve the tension; somehow the atmosphere
of the room was heavy and electric.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Josiah. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll not be surprised
if there is&mdash;and a big one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mossop showed a courteous surprise. This
question of a coming big war was a perennial subject
for discussion in social and business circles. It had
been for years and it had now come to rank in his
mind as purely academic. He could not bring himself
to believe in &ldquo;the big burst up&rdquo; that to some astute
minds had long seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any particular reason for thinking so just now?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>To the lawyer it was hardly a live issue; somehow it
was against all his habits of thought; but it was an act
of charity at this moment to direct the mind of his
client.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stands to reason,&rdquo; Josiah spoke with his usual decision.
&ldquo;Germany&rsquo;s got thousands of millions locked
up in her army. She&lsquo;ll soon be looking for some return
in the way of dividends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But one might say the same of us and our navy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our insurance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how they speak of their army, don&rsquo;t they?&mdash;with
Russia one side of them, France the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay, but&rdquo;&mdash;there was a pause which, brief
as it was, seemed to confer upon Mr. Munt an air
of profound wisdom&mdash;&ldquo;mark my words, Mossop,
they&rsquo;re not piling up all these armaments for nothing.
It&rsquo;s not their way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are so prosperous,&rdquo; said the lawyer.
&ldquo;They are hardly likely to risk the loss of their foreign
markets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing venture, nothing win. And they do say
the German workingman is waking up and that he is
asking for a share in the government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One hears all sorts of rumors, but in these matters
one likes to be an optimist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; Josiah looked very dour. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell
you this. I&rsquo;m main glad I got out of all my Continental
investments a year last March.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The solicitor had to own that that was a matter in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>which his client had shown uncommon foresight. The
present state of the market was a remarkable vindication
of his sagacity.</p>

<p>There was another little pause in which the solicitor,
himself an able man of business, could not help reflecting
upon the native shrewdness of this client so
keen, so hardheaded, so self-willed. And then it was
broken by Mr. Munt taking a step towards the door
and saying, &ldquo;When are you and the wife and daughter
coming to see us, Mossop? Come to a meal one
evening, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The invitation was point blank; but behind the lawyer&rsquo;s
genial courtesy was the trained fencer, the ready-witted
man of the world. &ldquo;Most kind of you,&rdquo; he
said heartily. &ldquo;Only too delighted, but, unfortunately,
my womenfolk are going up to Scotland to-morrow&rdquo;&mdash;he
gave private thanks to Allah that it was so!&mdash;&ldquo;and
I follow on Saturday, so perhaps if we may leave it
till our return&rdquo;&mdash;the solicitor raised his frank and
ready smile to the stern eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so, Mossop!&rdquo; The client frowned a little.
&ldquo;Leave it open. But I&rsquo;d like you to see the house.
And Mrs. M. would like to know your wife and
daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll like to know her, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; The air
of sincerity was balm. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve been so busy
gadding about just lately&rdquo;&mdash;the laugh was charming&mdash;&ldquo;that
they&rsquo;ve had to neglect their social duties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah was far too elemental to feel slighted, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>if the lawyer had not been so disarming. &ldquo;But you
people here on The Rise have the name of being a
stuck-up lot, especially some of you old standards.
And I&rsquo;m bound to say, Mossop, my experience is that
you seem to live up to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lawyer Mossop laughed his soft rich note as he
followed Mr. Munt across the hall. He opened the
front door for his client, and then, hatless as he was,
accompanied the visitor down the short drive as far
as the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice things here, Mossop,&rdquo; Josiah pointed to the
flower beds on either side. &ldquo;That a Charlotte Fanning?&rdquo;
A finger indicated a glorious white rose whose
dazzling purity of color stood out beyond all the rest.</p>

<p>Mr. Mossop said it was a Charlotte Fanning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not sure you are going to beat mine, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mossop said modestly that he did not expect to
do that. Mr. Munt had long been famous for his
roses; and by comparison the lawyer declared he was
but a novice. The client was flattered considerably by
the compliment.</p>

<p>At the gate, the proprietor of the Duke of Wellington
pointed to the distant gables of Strathfieldsaye, and
said, &ldquo;Well, come round when you get back. The
garden won&rsquo;t be much of a show for twelve months
yet, but the house is first class. I designed it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the winning charm which even Josiah, who
felt that he paid for it on the High Court scale could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>not resist, Mr. Mossop promised that he would come
round when he got back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t forget the wife and daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wife and daughter should come round too. And
then as the lord of Strathfieldsaye said, &ldquo;Good-night,
Mossop,&rdquo; and was about to turn away from the open
gate, he felt suddenly the hand of the solicitor upon
his shoulder and the impact of a pair of grave, kind
eyes. &ldquo;I wish, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Lawyer Mossop,
&ldquo;you could see your way to taking a fortnight to
think over that little matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not mere conventional man-of-the-worldly
good feeling. It was the human father, and the sheer
unexpectedness of the obtrusion through the highly
polished surface of the city&rsquo;s foremost solicitor caused
his client to take a sharp breath. But Josiah&rsquo;s strength
had always been that he knew his own mind. And he
knew it now. &ldquo;No, Mossop.&rdquo; A final shake of the
dour head. &ldquo;That gel is comin&rsquo; out of my will. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The solicitor sighed gently and closed the gate. And
then he stood a moment to watch the slow-receding
lurch of the elephantine figure up the road.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="VII">VII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;I</span>F that boy had lived&mdash;which he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; reflected
the lord of Strathfieldsaye as he opened carefully
the fresh painted gate of his own demesne, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
him to have been educated at Rugby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lawyer Mossop had been educated at Rugby. Somehow
that gentleman always left in the mind of this
shrewd, oddly perceptive client an impression of being
&ldquo;just right,&rdquo; of not having anything in excess. His
reputation in Blackhampton was very high. Just
as Dr. Perrin had been for years its leading physician,
Mr. Mossop had been for years its leading lawyer.
To be a patient of the one, a client of the other,
almost conferred a diploma of merit. Not only was
it a proof in itself of social standing, an ability &ldquo;to
pay for the best,&rdquo; but it also expressed a knowledge,
greatly valued by the elect, that the best was worth
paying for. Josiah was a firm believer in that maxim.</p>

<p>Still ... he closed the gate of Strathfieldsaye as
carefully as he had opened it ... when all was said
education was dangerous. Up to a point a good thing,
no doubt. You couldn&rsquo;t be a Lawyer Mossop without
it. But it was like vaccination: some people it
suited, others it didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a trim slight figure coming down the
path, in a hat not without pretensions to fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leaving us, Gert?&rdquo; said Josiah. &ldquo;Better stop to
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Preston reluctantly declined the invitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? Always a knife and fork for you here,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, Josiah, but they&rsquo;ll be waiting for me
at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you won&rsquo;t, you won&rsquo;t&mdash;but you&rsquo;d be very
welcome.&rdquo; And then he embraced the house and its
surroundings in a large gesture. &ldquo;One better than
Waterloo Villa, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Gerty, with tempered enthusiasm. She
looked at her brother-in-law with wary eyes. &ldquo;You
must be a very rich man, Josiah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He narrowed his gaze a little and scratched his
cheek delicately with the side of his forefinger, an odd
trick he had when thinking deeply on questions of
money. &ldquo;So, so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So, so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a place like this means <i>heaps</i> of money,&rdquo;
Gerty waved a knowledgeable parasol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay.&rdquo; It was the air of a very &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;
man indeed. &ldquo;The year after next I expect to
be mayor. And then&rdquo;&mdash;a note of triumph crept into
his voice&mdash;&ldquo;we may be able to show some of &rsquo;em a
thing or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Preston was diplomatically quite sure of that.
And yet as she stood with the crude bulk of Strath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>fieldsaye
behind her, she looked somehow a little dubious.
It was as if, respect this brother-in-law of hers
as she might, she had certain mental reservations in
regard to him.</p>

<p>He was too busy with his own thoughts to detect
what was passing in her mind; besides the curves of
his own mind were too large for him to care very
much even had he done so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to come to the show, Gert,&rdquo; he said
abruptly. &ldquo;To-morrow week&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerty began to hedge a bit, but he would take no
denial. It was her duty &ldquo;to bring Maria up to the
scratch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no way out, it seemed, so finally she
must make up her mind to yield and to suffer. It
would be a horrible affair&mdash;common people, brass
band, a general atmosphere of vulgarity and alcohol;
it would be all that her prim soul abhorred. And the
heat would be terrific. Her spirit quailed, but how
could the miserable Maria hope to get through without
her to lean upon! Besides if she showed the white
feather Josiah might lose some of his respect for her.
And she couldn&rsquo;t afford that, especially after it had
cost her so much for him to gain it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must get into the habit of showing herself to
the public as she&rsquo;s going to be mayoress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Preston quite saw that. She yielded with as
much grace as she could muster. Josiah took her down
to the gate and told her to mind the paint. And then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>as she was about to pass through, her gloved hand
was laid upon his arm, almost exactly as Lawyer Mossop&rsquo;s
had been, and she said softly and gravely in a
voice curiously similar, &ldquo;Josiah, if I were you, I should
not be in a hurry about ... about Sally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grimness of the eyes that met hers would have
scared most women, but Gertrude Preston was not
one to be frightened easily. There was hesitancy, a
slight nervousness, all the same.</p>

<p>Josiah shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly,
&ldquo;that gel is coming&rsquo; out o&rsquo; my will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The look of him as he stood there with the sun&rsquo;s
shadow falling across his heavy face told her that
argument would be worse than useless. Rather
abruptly she said good-night and marched primly
away along the road.</p>

<h2 id="VIII">VIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE annual Flower Show and Gala in Jubilee
Park was in part a serious function, in part a
popular festival. But its secondary aspect was undoubtedly
predominant.</p>

<p>Jubilee Park was sacred to those who thronged the
close-packed southern and eastern areas of the city.
Among many other things, held by the people of
Blackhampton to be vastly more important, the town
and its suburbs had a reputation for flowers. It was
odd that it should have. Except perhaps a subtle
quality in the soil, there was little in its corporate life
or in its physical expression to account for the fact
that it had long been famous for its roses. Among
the hundreds of allotment holders on the outskirts of
the city, practical rose growers abounded and these
claimed an apotheosis at the annual show in Jubilee
Park.</p>

<p>Almost the only vanity Mr. Josiah Munt had permitted
himself in his earlier days was that he was a
practical rose grower. He had competed at the show
ever since there had been a show, and he had garnered
so many prizes in the process that he now took
rank as an expert. But he was more than that. He
was now regarded as chief patron of a cult that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>largely confined to the humbler and the poorer classes.
A hard man, known throughout the city as very &ldquo;near&rdquo;
in his business dealings, he was a despiser of public
opinion and no seeker of popular applause. But of
late years, having grown remarkably prosperous and
a figure of ever-increasing consequence in the town,
he made a practice just once in the year of &ldquo;letting
himself out a bit&rdquo; at the function in Jubilee Park.</p>

<p>For one thing the Park itself was almost within a
stone&rsquo;s throw of the Duke of Wellington; and in Josiah&rsquo;s
opinion its sole merit was its contiguity to that
famous public house. Personally he despised Jubilee
Park and the class of persons who frequented it&mdash;they
were a common lot&mdash;but now he had taken rank
as the great man of this particular neighborhood,
wherein he had been born and had sown the seeds of
his fortune, it did him no harm in his own esteem
or in that of the people who had known him in humbler
days, once a year to savor his preëminence.</p>

<p>Tuesday, August the Fourth, was one of the hottest
days within the memory of Blackhampton. And in
that low-lying, over-populated area of which Jubilee
Park was the center it seemed hotter than anywhere
else. Being the day after Bank Holiday, a large section
of the community &ldquo;had taken another day off,&rdquo;
therefore several thousand persons of all ages and
both sexes assembled on the brown bare grass in the
course of the afternoon.</p>

<p>To say that the bulk of these had been attracted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>to those shadeless precincts by a display of roses
would be too polite a compliment. The Blackhampton
Prize Brass Band was the undoubted magnet of the
many. Then there were tea al fresco for the ladies,
a baby show and a beauty competition, beer and bowls
for the gentlemen, dancing to follow and also fireworks.
When the Show was considered in all its aspects,
the roses only appealed to a small minority; the
roses in fact were hardly more than a pretext for
a local saturnalia, but in the middle of the sward was
a large tent wherein the competing blooms were displayed.
Close by was a tent considerably less in size
if intrinsically the more imposing, to which a square
piece of cardboard was attached by a blue ribbon. It
bore the legend &ldquo;President and Committee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the entrance to this smaller tent a number of
important looking but perspiring gentlemen were seated
in a semicircle on garden chairs. And in the center
of these, with rather the air of Jupiter among his
satellites, was Mr. Josiah Munt. Several members
of the committee, all badged and rosetted as they were,
had removed their coats out of deference to the thermometer,
but the President was not of these. Under
the famous white pot hat, which in the southeastern
district of his native city was as famous as
the Gladstone collar and the Chamberlain eyeglass,
was artfully disposed a cool cabbage leaf, and over
all was a large white sun umbrella.</p>

<p>The sun umbrella marked a precedent. It was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>symbol, a herald of the President&rsquo;s ever advancing social
status. All the same it was not allowed to mar a
certain large geniality with which he always bore himself
at the Rose Show. By nature the proprietor of
the Duke of Wellington was not an expansive man,
particularly in the world of affairs, but once a year,
at least, he made a point of unbending as far as it
was in him to do so.</p>

<p>This afternoon the President was accessible to all
and sundry as of yore. Moreover he had followed
his time-honored custom of regaling the committee,
most of whom were &ldquo;substantial men&rdquo; and the cronies
of an earlier, more primitive phase in the ascending
fortunes of the future mayor of the city, with whisky
and cigars, conveyed specially from the Duke of Wellington
by George the head barman. But it was clear
as the afternoon advanced and the heat increased with
the ever-growing throng, that the subject of roses and
even the martial strains of Rule Britannia, Hearts of
Oak and other accepted masterpieces rendered with
amazing <i>brio</i> by the B.P.B.B. did not wholly occupy
the thoughts of these distinguished men.</p>

<p>Among the Olympians who sat in the magic semicircle
at the mouth of their own private tent and enjoyed
the President&rsquo;s whisky and cigars and the privilege
of personal intercourse with him was a foxy-looking
man with large ears and large spectacles. Julius
Weiss by name, he had migrated from his native Germany
thirty years before, and by specializing in what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>was technically known as &ldquo;a threepenny hair-cut&rdquo; had
risen to the position of a master hair-dresser with six
shops of his own in the city. A man of keen intelligence
and cosmopolitan outlook, there were times in
the course of the afternoon when he seemed to claim
more of the President&rsquo;s attention than the ostensible
business in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t trust our gov&rsquo;ment,&rdquo; said Josiah for
the tenth time, when a cornet solo, the Battle of
Prague (&ldquo;Bandsman Rosher&rdquo;) had been brought to a
triumphant close. &ldquo;Never have trusted &rsquo;em if it comes
to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a blooming Tory,&rdquo; ventured
the only hungry looking member of an extremely well-nourished
looking committee&mdash;an obvious intellectual
with piercing black eyes and fiercely picturesque mustache
whose hue was as the raven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Politics is barred, Lewis!&rdquo; It was the President&rsquo;s
Saturday morning manner at the City Hall, but its
austerity was tactfully mitigated by a dexterous passing
of the cigar box. &ldquo;We ought to go in now ...
this minute. What do you say, Weiss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The master hair-dresser screwed up a pair of vulpine
eyes and then replied in a low harsh guttural, &ldquo;It is
a big t&rsquo;ing to fight Chermany.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not afraid of you,&rdquo; interjected a pugnacious
Committee-man. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The President held up a stern finger. &ldquo;No, no,
Jennings.&rdquo; It was a breach of taste and the Presi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>dent
glared at the offender from under his cabbage
leaf. He had a deep instinct for fair play, a curious
impartiality that enabled him to see the merits of
Weiss as a taxpayer and a citizen. In the lump he
approved of Germans as little as any one else, but
such a man as Weiss with his unceasing industry, his
organizing capacity, his business ability and his social
qualities was a real asset to the city.</p>

<p>The little hair-dresser broke a solemn pause. &ldquo;<i>We</i>
are not ready for war.&rdquo; He stressed the &ldquo;we&rdquo; to the
plain annoyance of several committee-men, although
Josiah was not of the number. &ldquo;A month from now
they&rsquo;ll be in Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said the truculent Jennings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see, my tear,&rdquo; said Julius Weiss.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="IX">IX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>T five o&rsquo;clock Maria and Aunt Gerty arrived on
the scene. Blackhampton&rsquo;s future mayoress had
been taken very firmly in hand by her step-sister who
was fully determined that the social credit of Alderman
Munt should not be lowered in the sight of the
world. Gerty had really taken enormous pains with
a naturally timid and weakly constituted member of
society.</p>

<p>After a battle royal, in which tears had been shed,
the hapless Maria had been compelled to renounce a
pair of old-fashioned stays which on common occasions
foreshortened her figure to the verge of the grotesque,
in favor of sinuous, long-lined, straight-fronted
corsets. With such ruthless art had outlying and
overlapping portions of Maria been folded away within
their fashionable confines, that, as she breathlessly
remarked to her torturer as she looked in the glass,
&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t know herself, she didn&rsquo;t really.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria could hardly breathe as she waddled across
the parched expanse of Jubilee Park. She was more
miserably self-conscious than she had ever been in
the whole course of a miserably self-conscious existence.
Her corsets, she was sure, filled the world&rsquo;s
eye. At her time of life to take such liberties with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>the human form was hardly decent, it wasn&rsquo;t really.
Moreover Gerty had perched a great hat on the top
of her, almost a flower show in itself, the sort that
was worn, Gerty assured her, by the local duchess on
public occasions; and it was kept in place on a miraculous
new-fangled coiffure by a white veil with
black spots. Then her comfortable elastic-sided boots,
the stand-bys of a fairly long and very honorable life,
had gone by the board at the instance of the ruthless
Gerty. She had to submit to patent leathered, buckled
affairs, that could only be coaxed on to the human
foot by a shoehorn. No wonder that Mrs. Alderman
Munt walked with great delicacy across the baking expanse
of Jubilee Park. And the intensely respectable
black kid gloves that for more than half a century had
served her so well for chapel goings, prayer meetings,
weddings, funerals, christenings and the concerts of
the Philharmonic Society had been forced to yield to
a pair whose virgin whiteness in Maria&rsquo;s opinion carried
fashion to the verge of immodesty. Nor did even
these complete the catalogue of Gerty&rsquo;s encroachments.
There was also a long-handled black and white parasol.</p>

<p>As Maria and Gerty debouched across the grass,
Josiah arose from his chair in the midst of the committee
and strutted impressively past the bandstand
to receive them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mother, I hardly knew you.&rdquo; There was
high approval in the greeting. &ldquo;Up to the knocker,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>what!&rdquo; He offered a cordial hand to his heroically
beaming sister-in-law, &ldquo;How are you, Gert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies had been careful to have tea before they
came but this precaution did not avail. Josiah insisted
on their going into the special tent labeled &ldquo;Refreshments.&rdquo;
Here they had to sit on a form rickety and
uncomfortably narrow which promised at any moment
either to lay them prone beneath the tea urn
or enable them to form a parabola over against the
patent bread-cutter at the other end of the table.</p>

<p>The tea was lukewarm and undrinkable, the bread
and butter was thick and so uninviting that both ladies
were sure it was margarine, but after a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation in which she felt the stern eye of Josiah
upon her, the heroic Gerty dexterously removed one
white glove and came to grips with a plate of buttered
buns. In the buns were undeniable currants, and
their genial presence enabled Gerty to make a spirited
bluff at consuming them.</p>

<p>Where Gerty walked, Maria must not fear to tread.
The ladies got somehow through their second tea and
then they were haled into the open, past the bandstand
and through the crowd surrounding it, to the
large tent containing the exhibits. Here, in a select
corner, draped with festoons of red cloth, were the
prizes which Maria, half an hour hence, would be
called upon to distribute with her own white-gloved
hands to the victorious competitors.</p>

<p>The heat in the tent being unbearable the Presi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>dent&rsquo;s
party had it to themselves. Therefore Maria&rsquo;s
audible groan at the sight of the task before her was
heard by none save her lord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bear up, Mother,&rdquo; Josiah&rsquo;s tone was a highly judicious
blend of sternness, banter and persuasion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not as if you had to make a speech, you know. And
if you did have there&rsquo;s nobody here who&rsquo;d bite you.
I&rsquo;d see to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was encouraging, yet certain gyrations of the
black and white parasol betrayed to the lynx-eyed
Gerty the sinister presence of stage fright. &ldquo;Maria,&rdquo;
said the inexorable monitress, &ldquo;you must show Spirit.
Hold your sunshade as I&rsquo;ve shown you. Keep your
chin up. And try to smile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This counsel of perfection was, at the moment,
clearly beyond Maria. But the President&rsquo;s nod approved
it, and Gerty, one of those powerful spirits
that loves to do with public affairs, proceeded on a
flute-like note, &ldquo;Dear me, what lovely prizes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was hyperbole to speak of the prizes as lovely,
but it was, of course, the correct thing to say, and in
the ear of Josiah the correct thing was said in the
correct way. It would have been difficult for the
duchess herself to have bettered that pure note of
lofty enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so bad, Gert, are they? What do you think
o&rsquo; that little vawse? Presented by Coppin, the jeweler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To assess the gift of Coppin, the jeweler, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>necessary for Miss Preston to bring into action her
famous tortoiseshell folders. She had no need for
glasses at all. But Lawyer Mossop&rsquo;s aunt, the late
Miss Selina Gregg, had aroused in her a passion for
their use on appropriate occasions. &ldquo;A ducky little
vahse!&rdquo; That vexed word was pronounced after the
manner of the late Miss Gregg, from whose practice
there was no appeal.</p>

<p>&rdquo;Not so bad&mdash;for Coppin. Better anyway than his
silver-plated eggstand last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerty made an admiring survey of the bounty of
the patrons of the Blackhampton Rose Growers&rsquo; Association.
&ldquo;And here, I see, is the President&rsquo;s special
prize.&rdquo; She had kept in reserve her appreciation of
this <i>chef d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> of public munificence, a much beribboned
silver gilt goblet to which a card was attached,
&ldquo;President&rsquo;s Special Prize for Rose of Purest
Color. Donor Alderman Munt J.P.&rdquo; It was the first
thing her eye had lit on, but she had worked up to it
slowly, via the lesser gifts of lesser men, so that
anything in the nature of anticlimax might be avoided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Josiah, tell me, who is the fortunate winner?&rdquo; The
archness of the tone verged upon coquetry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look and see, my gel.&rdquo; The response was unexpectedly
gruff. But, as soon as Gerty had looked
and seen, the reason for the President&rsquo;s austerity grew
clear. On a second card, smaller but beribboned like
the first, was inscribed in a fair clerkly hand, &ldquo;Presented
to Mr. W. Hollis for Exhibit 16.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="X">X</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>AD a pin fallen in the tent at that moment, any
one of those three people might have expected
to hear it do so. Gerty was too wise to ask why the
husband of the outcast Melia had come to enjoy the
special gift of his father-in-law; Maria simply dare
not. In truth it was an odd story. Josiah did his
best to put a gloss on an incredible fact of which he
was rather ashamed; it looked so much like moral
weakness, a public giving in; but, as he informed
Gerty with a half apologetic air, Jannock was Jannock.
In other words, fair play in the eyes of honest
men was a jewel.</p>

<p>There could be no question that, in point of color,
the fairest bloom sent in was Exhibit Sixteen. It
was a rose of such a dazzling snowy whiteness that
it had caught and held the expert eye of the President
at the morning inspection. &ldquo;An easy winner,
Jennings,&rdquo; he had said, as soon as he had seen it,
&ldquo;Nothing to put beside it, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The astute Jennings, a professional nurseryman
along The Rise, made no comment. He had taken
the trouble to find out the name of the grower before
bringing a mature judgment to bear on the fruits of
his craft. &ldquo;Sound&rdquo; criticism is always a priori. Crit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>ics
who value their reputation are careful not to pronounce
an opinion on any work of art until they know
who has produced it. Otherwise mistakes are apt
to occur. None knew better than Jennings that the
grower of Exhibit Sixteen could not hope to receive
the President&rsquo;s prize; indeed Jennings was amazed at
the little tick&rsquo;s impudence in daring to compete at all
for his father-in-law&rsquo;s silver gilt goblet. It was an
act of bravado. Jennings, therefore, shook his head
coldly. He declined to show enthusiasm in the presence
of what to the unsuspecting eye of the President
was an almost too obvious masterpiece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All over a winner, Jennings, that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jennings shook the sober head of a professional expert.
&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Twenty-one &rsquo;as more quality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rubbish, man!&rdquo; The President threw up his head
sharply, a favorite trick when goaded by contradiction.
&ldquo;Twenty-one can&rsquo;t be mentioned on the same
day o&rsquo; the week. What do you say, Penney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Mr. Councilor Penney, an acknowledged
light of the a priori school of criticism, ventured to
express an opinion he winged a glance at Nurseryman
Jennings. And that glance, in the technical language
of experts, conveyed a clear request for &ldquo;the office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The office&rdquo; was given sotto voce behind the adroit
hand of Jennings, &ldquo;Mester Munt&mdash;Twenty-one, Sixteen&mdash;Bill
Hollis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Councilor Penney closed one eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>and proceeded to examine the competing blooms.
&ldquo;Well, Mester Munt,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;I am bound
to say, to my mind Twenty-one &rsquo;as it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The impetuous president had a short way with the
Councilor Penneys of the earth. &ldquo;Have you no eyes,
man! Twenty-one can&rsquo;t live beside Sixteen. Not the
same class. Look at the color&mdash;look at the shape&mdash;look
at the size&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was realized now that it had become necessary
to warn the President. And the situation must be
grappled with at once. The deeper the President
floundered, the more perilous the job of extrication.
Rescue was a man&rsquo;s work, but finally in response to
a mute appeal from the pusillanimous Jennings, Mr.
Councilor Penney took his courage in his hands. &ldquo;Mr.
Munt,&rdquo; he said warily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that Twenty-one
was sent in by Joe Mellers, your own gardener?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the best that Mr. Councilor Penney could
muster in the way of tact. But at all times a very
great deal of tact was needed to handle the President.
Clearly the shot was not a lucky one. &ldquo;Nowt
to do with it, Penney.&rdquo; The great man nearly bit
off his head. &ldquo;Ought to know that. Sixteen&rsquo;s the
best bloom on the bench.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixteen&rsquo;s that Hollis!&rdquo; It was an act of pure
valor on the part of Mr. Councilor Penney. Nurseryman
Jennings held his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Hollis!&rdquo; The President repeated the words
calmly. For a moment it was not certain that human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>dignity could accept their implication. But there was
a world of meaning in the nervous frown of Mr. Councilor
Penney, in the tense furtiveness of Nurseryman
Jennings.</p>

<p>Was it possible?... Was it possible that the little
skunk had dared?... Had dared to compete at this
show of all shows?... Had dared to win honestly
that prize of all prizes?...</p>

<p>The story of Bill Hollis and Melia Munt was a
commonplace with every member of the Committee.
They were familiar with all the circumstances; and
though there might be those among them who felt privately
that their august President carried family pride
rather far, even these could not help admiring the
rigidity of his attitude. It meant enormous strength
of character; and character in the shrine at which the
true Briton worships. But now that the Committee
was up against the problem Bill Hollis had raised they
keenly regretted that they had not taken steps to disqualify
him from the outset, or had not apprised the
President beforehand of the state of the case.</p>

<p>The pause that followed was rather irksome for all
parties. It was ended at last by Nurseryman Jennings.
That practical expert, having enjoyed an afternoon
of free whisky at the President&rsquo;s expense,
was now able to clothe his judgment becomingly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose the little Snot grew it hisself!&rdquo; said
Jennings.</p>

<p>Half the Committee saw at once that a way out had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>been found for the President. But the President was
not of the number. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>

<p>The practical expert was hardly prepared with reasons.
Why should he be? His doubts were inspired
by the purest altruism. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you, Jennings?&rdquo;
repeated the President.</p>

<p>Really there is no helping some people!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; It was rather lame, but Jennings
was doing his best in extremely trying circumstances.</p>

<p>The longer, tenser pause that followed none was
stout enough to break. Up to a hundred might have
been counted before the President said, slowly and
gruffly, as a large and shaggy bear endowed with a
few limited human vocables might have done, &ldquo;Have
the goodness, Jennings, to mark Exhibit Sixteen for
the President&rsquo;s Special.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="XI">XI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HUS it was, that among the successful competitors
who lined up by the bandstand at six
o&rsquo;clock to receive awards of merit from the fair hands
of Mrs. Alderman Munt, was her son-in-law Mr.
William Hollis.</p>

<p>Wonders never cease to happen in a world of wonders.
When in a moment of sheer bravado Bill Hollis
had paid the necessary shilling and had entered the
choicest bloom in his garden for the Annual Show he
would have staked his davy that he stood about as
much chance of walking off with the Special Prize as
he did of going to heaven in a golden chariot. The
Old Un himself would see to that.</p>

<p>Taken on its merits, this pure white rose that had
come as the crown of many years of loving labor
would be hard to beat. But, as Bill Hollis knew,
things are not taken on their merits by the a priori
school of criticism. He knew that its judgments are
conditioned by many things and that intrinsic worth
is apt to weigh least in the scale. He had shown his
bloom in pride and defiance; he had not expected to
get anything by it; and now that the despised Committee
had acted better than itself he was inclined to
regret that it had not lived up to its reputation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>The table containing the prizes had been carried out
on to the grass. Beside it stood Mrs. Alderman
Munt, white-gloved and anxious, her eyes not unlike
those of a frightened rabbit. And yet lurking somewhere
in the folds of a rather redundant frame was
a certain dignity, as there is bound to be in one who
has given four children to the state; in one, moreover,
who has accompanied such a mate as Josiah step by
step in his steady rise to wealth and power. Beside
Mrs. Munt stood the secretary of the society, an important
pince-nezed gentleman, with a scroll in his
hand bearing the names of the prize winners; immediately
behind these, on a row of chairs, were various
notabilities, among whom Alderman Munt was conspicuously
foremost; and then facing them, in a curious,
rather impressed semicircle, were the members
of that general public which not for worlds would
miss anything in the nature of a giving of prizes by
the wife of a real live alderman.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the Duke of Wellington sat glaring
fiercely from under his white billycock hat, clutching
a little convulsively the knob of his sun umbrella.
A ruthless eye raked the distant corps of successful
competitors, as one by one they came round
the corner of the bandstand and converged upon the
timid lady whose task it was publicly to reward their
skill. All were awkward, some were abashed, some
tried to hide their feelings by an ill-timed facetiousness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>There he was, the little dog! Josiah&rsquo;s grip tightened
on the knob of the sun umbrella. If the little
cur had &ldquo;had a drop,&rdquo; as he most probably had, he
was very likely to insult Maria&mdash;it was such a great,
such a golden, opportunity. Josiah was not troubled
as a rule by vain regrets, but as the Secretary in his
far flung voice announced, &ldquo;President&rsquo;s Special Prize
for best Single Bloom, winner Mr. W. Hollis,&rdquo; and
there came an expectant hush in which the meager
form of Mr. W. Hollis emerged into the full glare of
the public gaze, his father-in-law would have paid a
substantial sum to be able to rescind his recent verdict.
The little Stoat could not be expected to bear
himself like a gentleman.</p>

<p>Aunt Gerty, standing prim and tense at the back of
the invertebrate Maria, grew as white as if she had
seen a ghost. But she drew in her thin lips sternly
and, great warrior as she was, literally transfixed poor
Melia&rsquo;s declassé husband with her tortoiseshell folders.
How common he was! It was really very stupid
of Josiah to let him have a prize in such circumstances.
It was very stupid, indeed! He was just the kind of
man who might be tempted to indulge in some form
of cheap revenge.</p>

<p>As Melia&rsquo;s husband shuffled across the grass Josiah
held himself ready to spring upon him. Public or no
public he would certainly do so if the little beast made
any sign of insulting Maria. But as Bill Hollis came
slowly and doggedly into the picture he was visited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>by a reluctant grace. Half way across the grass,
midway between the bandstand and the alderman&rsquo;s
lady, he took his shabby hands from his shabby pockets;
a little farther on several degrees of slouch passed
from the unpleasing curve of his narrow shoulders.
And finally, as the silver gilt goblet was bestowed upon
him by a pair of trembling hands, he ducked solemnly,
the best he could do in the way of a bow, and then
retired modestly, silently, respectfully, the trophy under
his arm.</p>

<p>Josiah and Aunt Gerty breathed again. Great was
their relief. And so intensely had they been preoccupied
with the bearing of Melia&rsquo;s husband, that, very
luckily for Maria, they were not able to notice hers.
It was well this was so. For the alderman&rsquo;s lady
had disgraced herself on an important public occasion
by allowing her eyes to fill with tears.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XII">XII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ILL&rsquo;S first thought was to take the trophy
straight home to his wife. But for various reasons
he didn&rsquo;t obey it. Relations had grown very
strained between Melia and himself. For months past
she had been giving him such a bad time that there
was little pleasure to be got out of his home.</p>

<p>He was a bit of an idealist in his way. Sixteen
years ago, at any rate, he had begun married life by
idealizing his home and Melia. But Melia was not an
idealist. She was a decidedly practical person, and,
like her father, endowed with much shrewd sense. In
a perverse hour she had yielded against her better
judgment to the quiet persistency of William Hollis;
but almost before she married him she knew it
wouldn&rsquo;t answer. In her heart she wanted somebody
better. She felt that a daughter of Josiah Munt was
entitled to somebody better. And in waiving all her
rights as the eldest child of a tyrannical, overbearing
father, the least she could ask of the man to whose
star she had pinned her faith was that he should
prove himself a forcible and successful citizen.</p>

<p>Unhappily Bill had proved to be neither. He was
a wordster, a dreamer; there was nothing at the back
of his rose-colored ideas. It was not that he was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>vicious man. For such a nature as Melia&rsquo;s it had
perhaps been better if he had been. She asked for
the positive in man, even positive badness; anything
rather than muddling mediocrity, ignoble envy of
other men&rsquo;s prosperity and continual whinings against
fate.</p>

<p>There were times when Melia was so bored with the
inadequacy of this mate of hers that she half hoped
to goad him into getting drunk enough to repay some
of her insults with a good beating. At least it would
have been an event, an excitement. But he was not
even a thorough-going drinker; at the best, or the
worst, he never drank enough beer to rise to the heroic,
as a real man might have done; his deepest potations
did not carry him beyond maudlin sentiment or
vapid braggadocio, both very galling to a woman of
spirit. And now, having realized that there was nothing
to hope for, that they were going steadily down a
hill at the bottom of which was the gutter&mdash;just as
her clear-sighted father had predicted from the first&mdash;years
of resentment had crystallized into a hard and
fixed hostility. She had an ever-growing contempt
for the spineless fool who was dragging her down
in his own ruin.</p>

<p>Bill&rsquo;s instinct was to go home at once with the silver
gilt goblet. In spite of all the bitterness the last few
years had brought him he still had a wish to please
Melia. In spite of a cat and dog existence they were
man and wife. They had lived sixteen years together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>but he still wished to propitiate her. But hardly had
he borne his prize through the throng by the bandstand
and begun to steer for the main gate of Jubilee
Park than there came a change of mind.</p>

<p>It was one of those sudden, causeless changes of
mind that was always overtaking him. He never
seemed able to do anything now for the reason that
almost before he had decided upon one thing he was
overpowered by a desire to do another. He had not
reached the park gate before he felt the humiliation
of accepting such a prize from such hands; and Melia
would probably tell him that he ought to have had
more self-respect than to take it&mdash;if she thought it
worth while to express herself on the subject.</p>

<p>The President&rsquo;s Special Prize would bring no pleasure
to Melia. True, there was no need to tell her
whence it came. No ... there was no need! Suddenly
the band broke into a hearty strain. Beyond a
doubt the atmosphere of Jubilee Park was far more genial
than that of Number Five Love Lane. Perhaps he
ought to have brought Melia to witness his triumph.
One reason was that he had been far from expecting
it; another, that he daren&rsquo;t invite her. For many
months now she had been careful to keep herself to
herself, declining always to be seen with him in public.</p>

<p>There was a vacant seat by the gate, out of the sun
and within sound of the gay music. This, after all,
was far better than Number Five Love Lane. For a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>few brief moments &ldquo;The Merry Widow&rdquo; (selection)
made him feel happier. It would have been nice for
Melia&mdash;still it couldn&rsquo;t be helped. He ought to have
refused the prize&mdash;still he had honestly won it. But
only an oversight on the part of the blinking Committee
had given it him; he could read that in Josiah&rsquo;s
ugly mug and in the face of that stuck-up Gerty Preston&mdash;so
it was one in the eye for them after all! And
what price Ma! Her son-in-law broke into a guffaw
of melancholy laughter. The old barrel-bodied image
got up like one of the Toffs! And yet ... how her
hands trembled! ... white gloves on &rsquo;em too! ... and
that was a queer look she gave him. The old girl,
after all, was the best of a rotten bunch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Merry Widow&rdquo; crashed to an abrupt finale,
and a light went out suddenly, as it so often did, in
the heart of Bill Hollis. Again the stern edge of
reality pressed upon him from every side, but almost
at once it was swept away by a new excitement. And
yet the excitement was not so new as it seemed. All
the afternoon it had been present, a chorus, a background,
thrilling and momentous, to a series of formal
proceedings to which it had nothing in common, to
which it did not bear the slightest relation, and yet
with a power truly sinister to cast a pall over them.</p>

<p>A youth with lungs of brass came through the gate
crying the Blackhampton <i>Evening Star</i>.</p>

<p>Terrible Fighting in Belgium! Awful German
Losses! Great Speech by Sir Edward Grey!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>A sharp thrill ran through the veins of Bill Hollis.
It was one more lively variation on a theme that had
been kindling his senses at short intervals throughout
the afternoon. War, a real big war, was coming, had
come. Of course to him personally it wouldn&rsquo;t matter,
except that it might make life more interesting.
Yes, somehow it was bound to do that. Whether it
would make it interesting enough for a man like himself
to care to go on living, that was another question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here y&rsquo;are, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy came across the grass, handed Bill an
<i>Evening Star</i> and firmly declined the halfpenny that
was offered him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Penny, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A penny for a <i>Star</i> was unheard of. Even the result
of the Derby, the result of the match with Yorkshire,
the result of the Cup Final itself could not command
a penny. Evidently this war, now that it had
come at last, was going to be a Record.</p>

<p>Yes, a Record. All the same he was not going to
pay a penny for it. One halfpenny was the legal
price of the Blackhampton <i>Evening Star</i>, and he told
the boy &ldquo;that if he had any of his sauce he&rsquo;d have
the police of him.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XIII">XIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ILLIAM HOLLIS, having defeated the boy,
turned his back to the sun and was assured by
the Blackhampton <i>Star</i> that he was living in a great
moment of the world&rsquo;s history. Germany had, it
seemed, until twelve o&rsquo;clock that evening to decide
whether she would take on England. She had taken
on France, Russia and Belgium already; a few hours
hence, if she wasn&rsquo;t careful, she would have to fight
the British Empire.</p>

<p>Even to Bill Hollis, dizzied by the sheer magnitude
of the headlines of his favorite journal which actually
surpassed those of the Crippen trial, the sinking of the
<i>Titanic</i> and the late King Edward&rsquo;s visit to Blackhampton,
that phrase &ldquo;the British Empire&rdquo; was full of
magic. Lurking somewhere in a compound of half-baked
inefficiencies was the vision of a poet, and at this
moment it was queerly responsive to this symbol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up with &rsquo;em if they take on Us.&rdquo; In strict
order of priority that was the first message to flash
through the sentient being of Mr. William Hollis to
be duly recorded by the central office. Hard upon it
came a second message. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a Nerve&mdash;them
Germans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the column for late news were blurred fragments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>of the speech of the Foreign Minister in the House of
Commons. Intellectually William Hollis was not conspicuously
bright, but, as he read the simple words,
the nature of the terrible misprision against the human
race came home to him and he could only gasp.</p>

<p>He got up presently and moved away from the
band. As always the band was very nice, but for some
reason or other he didn&rsquo;t want to hear it just now.
For a short time he walked about on the brown grass,
the President&rsquo;s cup under his arm, wrapped in the
<i>Evening Star</i>. But he wasn&rsquo;t thinking now of the
President, of the cup, of Melia, of the injustice of
Fate to a private citizen. His thoughts were centered
on a Thing that made all these other things, painfully
intimate as they were, of no moment at all. These
were but trivial matters, and he was now in the presence
of the inconceivable, the stupendous.</p>

<p>Coming back to the throng, perhaps for the latent
solace these clusters of fellow beings afforded him,
he saw from their blank eyes, their set faces, that his
own terrible thoughts were shared more or less by
them all. The boy had sold his papers already. Other
boys had sold theirs. The whole place was alive with
fluttering news sheets, gleaming white and spectral
in the sun. Already these people, these stout females
in farcical clothes, for the most part trundling queer
abortions on the end of a string, and these hard-faced,
grasping men who were always overreaching one in
trade, were living in a different world. They were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>not thinking now of flowers and vegetables, of bands
or dancing, although the first couples of juniors had
just begun to sway rhythmically to the strains of
&ldquo;Hitchy Koo.&rdquo; Something else had come into their
lives.</p>

<p>Passing the tent sacred to the President and Committee,
it gave him one more thrill to mark the bearing
of the grandees. The famous white hat no longer
adorned the head of the President. The great man
nursed it upon his fat loud-checked knees. All the
reluctant geniality a public function had inspired had
passed from his ugly face. Yet in the purview of his
son-in-law it looked a little less ugly at that moment
than he ever remembered to have seen it. Those fierce
eyes were not occupied now with the narrow round of
their own affairs, nor with a swelling vision of self-importance.
The world was on fire. He was simply
a man among his fellow men; and like them he was
wondering what ought to be done.</p>

<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock a vaguely excited but profoundly
depressed William Hollis made his way out of Jubilee
Park. He turned down Short Hill in the direction of
his home. But by the time he had reached the foot of
that brief declivity, and was involved in an airless
maze of bricks and mortar, the thought of his home
grew suddenly intolerable. He needed freedom and
space, he needed an atmosphere more congenial. Melia
would not understand. Or if she did understand she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>would be dumb and just now he simply longed for a
little human intercourse.</p>

<p>At the end of Love Lane, a mean and crooked little
street debouching from the Mulcaster Road which
wound a somber trail to the very heart of the city, he
stood a moment gazing at the dingy sign a few doors
up on the left, W. Hollis, Fruiterer. The obvious
course was to go and deposit the prize he had won on
the dresser in the back sitting room, or still better,
give it into the personal care of Melia. But instead,
he wrapped up the trophy a little more carefully, resettled
it under his arm, and then allowed himself to
drift slowly with the throng in the direction of the
Market Place.</p>

<p>As was usual with him now, his actions were aimless
and uncertain. There was no particular reason why
he should be going to the Market Place beyond the
fact that other people seemed to be going there, as
somehow they always did seem to be going there at
great moments in the national life. The factories and
warehouses who happened to be working that day had
disgorged their human cargoes and these under the
stimulus of hourly editions of the <i>Evening Star</i> were
moving slowly and solemnly towards the nodal point.</p>

<p>What the Market Place is to the city as a whole,
Waterloo Square is to the teeming, close-packed population
of its southeastern area. And at the busiest
corner of Waterloo Square, at its confluence with Mulcaster
Road, that main artery which leads directly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>the center of all things, is the Duke of Wellington public
house. William Hollis, drifting with the tide, felt
a sudden, uncontrollable desire to &ldquo;have one&rdquo; at this
famous landmark of the local life.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington was a &ldquo;free&rdquo; house and
Mr. Josiah Munt had been able to maintain in its integrity
the declining art of brewing Blackhampton Old
Ale. This had a bite and a sting in it, with which the
more diluted beverages of &ldquo;tied&rdquo; houses could not
compare. At the Duke of Wellington you paid for the
best and you got it; therefore it was patronized by all
in the neighborhood who knew what was what; it had,
moreover, peculiar advantages of tradition and geography
which gave it a cachet of its own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To have one&rdquo; at the Duke of Wellington, in the
eyes of those who lived near by, was almost on a par
with &ldquo;looking in&rdquo; at Brooks&rsquo;s or the Carlton. It conferred
a kind of diploma of local worth and responsibility.
At the same time no form of politics was
barred, but the proprietor himself was a staunch conservative
and it was very difficult to find a welcome
in the bar parlor without sharing that faith.</p>

<p>It could not be said that William Hollis had ever
aspired to the good graces of the house. There were
obvious reasons why this was the case. For sixteen
years he had not passed through its doors; in that
long period he had not even entered the humbler part
of the premises known as &ldquo;the vaults,&rdquo; sacred to Tom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>Dick and Harry, where the more substantial patrons
of the establishment disdained to set foot.</p>

<p>To-night, however, new and strange forces were at
work in Bill. Borne along a tide of cosmic events as
far as those fascinating doors he was suddenly and
quite irrationally mastered by a desire to go in.</p>

<p>Partly it may have been bravado; certainly it was a
daring act to cross that threshold. But Josiah himself,
for whose personal prowess his son-in-law had a
wholesome respect, was safe at the Show; besides, the
proprietor was too great a man these days to visit the
house very often. Years ago he had ceased to reside
there with his family; and in his steady social ascent
he was careful not to emphasize a dubious but extremely
lucrative connection with that which regarded
in perspective was but a common public house.</p>

<p>The chances were that Bill Hollis would be spared
this evening an encounter with his father-in-law and
former master. But why he should decide so suddenly
to take the risk was hard to say, unless it was the half
fantastic reaction of an exceedingly impressionable
mind to a crisis almost without a precedent in human
experience. By nature a sociable fellow, he had now
an intense desire to exchange ideas with responsible,
knowledgeable people, with those possessing more
light than himself. The Duke of Wellington was the
headquarters of such in that part of the city; it was
the haunt of the quidnuncs and the well informed; and
it may have been for that reason that Bill dived sud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>denly
through the swing doors, an act he had not performed
for sixteen years, and crossed the dark, cool
passage with its highly spiced but not unattractive
odors.</p>

<p>It may have been the magnitude of the situation in
Europe which had suddenly rendered all private matters
ridiculous, or it may have been the talisman under
his arm which inspired him with an unwonted
hardihood, but instead of turning into the taproom,
the first on the left, which would have satisfied the
claims of honor and wisdom, he pushed boldly on past
the glass-surrounded cubicle of the celebrated but
haughty Miss Searson, into the Mecca of the just and
the good, sublimely guarded by that peri.</p>

<p>In a kind of dull excitement he entered the famous
Bar Parlor. To his surprise, and rather perversely,
to his relief, it was empty, except that, behind a
counter in a strategical angle that commanded the
room as well as the passage, Miss Searson was overwhelmingly
present, but absorbed apparently at that
moment in crocheting a two-inch lace border to an
article of female attire sacred to the pages of the realists.</p>

<p>Nothing seemed to have altered in sixteen years,
even to the fly-blown advertisement of Muirhead&rsquo;s
Pale Brandy facing the door, and surrounding Miss
Searson the double row of brass taps, it had once been
a part of his duties to keep clean. And that lady
herself, sixteen years had altered her surprisingly lit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>tle,
if at all. She was what is known technically as a
chemical blonde, a high-bosomed, high-voiced, large-featured,
large-earringed lady, with remarkable teeth
and an aloofness of manner which might almost be
said to enforce respect at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>When Miss Searson looked up from her crochet she
could hardly believe her eyes. William Hollis, in his
former incarnation, had been known to her as Bill the
Barman, and she in that distant epoch had been known
to him as a Stuck-Up Piece. Unofficially of course.
Outwardly everybody paid deference to Miss Searson;
even the proprietor himself, if he could be said to
pay deference to any human being, had always adopted
that attitude to Miss Searson; as for Bill the Barman,
he had been hardly more than a worm in her
sight. And then had come the Great Romance. It
had come like a bolt out of clear sky, knocking a whole
world askew as Miss Searson understood it; a whole
world of sacred values by which Miss Searson and
those within her orbit regulated their lives.</p>

<p>The entrance of Bill Hollis into the bar struck Miss
Searson dumb with surprise. In a mind temporarily
bewildered sixteen years were as but a single day.
This was the first occasion in that long period that the
incredible adventurer who had suborned the eldest
daughter of his stern master into marrying him had
dared to revisit the scene of his crime. To weak
minds a great romance, no doubt, but the lady behind
the bar had not a weak mind, therefore she was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>in the least romantic. She saw things as they were,
she knew what life was. It was very well for such
things to happen in the pages of a novel, but in the
daily round of humdrum existence they simply didn&rsquo;t
answer.</p>

<p>It seemed an age to Miss Searson before William
the Incredible girded his courage to the point of ordering
a pint of bitter. She drew it in stately silence,
handed it across the counter and accepted threepence
with superb hauteur.</p>

<p>He drank a little. It was no mean brew; and he
felt so much a man for the experience that he was
able to ask Miss Searson what she thought of the
news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;News,&rdquo; said Miss Searson loftily. &ldquo;News?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;War with Germany.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; A Juno-like toss of Miss Searson&rsquo;s
coiffure. But there she stopped. War with Germany
was none of her business, nor was it going to
be her business to be forced into conversation with
a character whose standing was so doubtful as the
former barman. Miss Searson was not a believer in
finesse. Her methods had a brutal simplicity which
made them tremendously effective.</p>

<p>However, this evening they were less effective than
usual. The world itself was tottering, and a deep,
deep chord in the amazing Bill Hollis was responsive
to the cataclysm. This evening he was not himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>he was more than himself; his appearance in the Private
Bar was proof of it.</p>

<p>Miss Searson was but a woman, a human female.
She meant nothing, she meant less than nothing in
this hour of destiny. &ldquo;Yes, that!&rdquo; He filled in the
pause, after waiting in vain for her to do so. &ldquo;War
with Germany. Do you realize it?&rdquo; His voice was
full of emotion.</p>

<p>But Miss Searson did not intend to be drawn into
a discussion of anything so fanciful as war with Germany.
She was practical. A censorious mouth shut
like a trap. She regarded Bill with the eye of a codfish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you realize what it means?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By an adroit turn of the head towards the farther
beer-engine she gave William Hollis the full benefit of
a pile of stately back hair. And then she said slowly,
as if she were trying to bite off the head of each blunt
syllable, &ldquo;Do you realize that the Mester sometimes
looks in about this time of a Thursday?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="XIV">XIV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span> NORMAL Bill Hollis would not have been
slow to analyze this speech and to find a lurking
insult. But he was not a normal Bill Hollis this evening;
it was the last place he was likely to be in if he
had been. Therefore he shook his head gently at Miss
Searson without submitting her to any more destructive
form of criticism. What a fool the woman was,
what a common fool not to understand that in the
presence of a war with Germany nothing else could
possibly matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d stop here&mdash;if I was you.&rdquo; Yes,
there was a bluntness about Miss Searson which at
ordinary times had a unique power of &ldquo;getting there.&rdquo;
But Bill merely smiled at her now. The chrysanthemum-topped
fathead! Suddenly he reached the limit
of his endurance; he expressed a boundless contempt
for her and all her tribe by recourse to a spittoon.</p>

<p>How <i>could</i> Melia ever have married him ...
Melia Munt who might have married an architect!...</p>

<p>Bill Hollis defensively went on with his bitter. He
was consumed with scorn of a person whom he had
once respected immensely. She was found out, the
shallow fool, fringe and back hair included! When
he came to the end of the pint, he paused a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>in the midst of the pleasant sensations it had inspired
and then decided that he would have another,
not because he wanted another, but because he felt
that it would annoy this Toplofty Crackpot.</p>

<p>The second pint did annoy the T.C., annoyed her
obviously; emotionally she was a very obvious lady.
But it was odd that Bill Hollis, shaken to the depths
by a world catastrophe, should desire a cheap revenge
and stoop to gratify it. Perhaps it was a case of
multiple personality. There were several Bill Hollises
in this moment of destiny.</p>

<p>There was the Bill Hollis who gave the defiant
order for another pint of bitter, the Bill Hollis who
paid for it with truculent coolness, the Bill Hollis who
bore it to the window the better to regard the somber
stream of fellow citizens flowing steadily in the direction
of the Market Place, the Bill Hollis who took a
beer-stained copy of the Blackhampton <i>Tribune</i> from
a table with a marble top and glanced at the portentous
headings of its many columns. And finally there
was the Bill Hollis who suddenly heard with a sick
thrill that came very near to nausea a footfall heavily
familiar and a voice outside in the passage.</p>

<p>Could it be...! Could it be that...!</p>

<p>There was a look of obvious triumph on the almost
unnaturally fair countenance of Miss Searson. In
her grim eyes was &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ex-barman, in the peril of the moment, glanced
hastily around, but the eyes of Miss Searson assured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>him that he was a rat and that he was caught in a
trap. Moreover they assured him that if ever rat deserved
a fate so ignominious, William Hollis was the
name of that rodent. And the loathsome animal had
time to recall before that voice and those footsteps
were able to enter the private bar that sixteen years
ago Miss Searson had been the witness of a certain
incident. And if her warlike bearing meant anything
she was now looking for a repetition, with modern
improvements and variations.</p>

<p>Escape was impossible, that was clear. And on the
strength of a fact so obvious all the various kinds of
Bill Hollises promptly came together and decided to
hand over the body politic to the only Bill Hollis who
could hope to deal with the crisis. This was the Bill
Hollis who had had a pint and a half of his father-in-law&rsquo;s
excellent bitter and felt immeasurably the better
for it.</p>

<p>As a measure of precaution this Bill Hollis spread
wide the <i>Tribune</i> and by taking cover behind it greatly
reassured his brethren. None of the others would
have had the wit to think of that. Even as it was only
a pint and a half of a very choice brew enabled the
device to be put coolly and quietly into practice.</p>

<p>He had hardly taken cover when Josiah came in.
Following close behind were Julius Weiss and Councilor
Kersley. It was a tense moment, but these grandees
were occupied with a matter more important than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>the identity of the man behind the newspaper in the
corner by the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Searson!&rdquo; The tone of the proprietor was
like unto that of Jove. &ldquo;Ring up Strathfieldsaye and
tell them I am going to eat at the Club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bill Hollis was sensible of a thrill. He was a mere
cat in the presence of a king, except that this was a
king whom he dare not look at. It was a disgusting
feeling yet somehow it was exalting. And this sense
of uplift grew when Josiah and his friends disposed
themselves augustly at one of the tables with a marble
top, and three tankards of an exclusive brew were
brought to them and they began to talk.</p>

<p>It was &ldquo;inner circle talk&rdquo; and in the ear of William
Hollis that lent it piquancy. Really it was what he
was there for. The newspapers were unsatisfying.
He craved to hear the matter discussed by men of substance,
standing, general information, by men of the
world. Sitting there behind his paper in the private
bar, he felt nearer to the heart of things than he had
ever been in his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it going to make so much difference?&rdquo; Councilor
Kersley, the eminent retail grocer, asked the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to alter everything, Kersley&mdash;you mark
me.&rdquo; The tone of Josiah was as final as an act of
parliament and Julius Weiss slowly nodded in deep
concurrence with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we shall down &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Councilor
Kersley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we shall down &rsquo;em, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Josiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;but&rdquo;
left a good deal to the imagination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure, my friends,&rdquo; said the master-hair-dresser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our Navy&rsquo;ll settle it at the finish,&rdquo; Josiah&rsquo;s growl
was that of a very big dog.</p>

<p>Julius Weiss shook his head solemnly but he didn&rsquo;t
speak again. An odd, uneasy silence settled on the
three of them while they drank their beer. But of
a sudden there came a wholly unexpected obtrusion
into the conversation.</p>

<p>The man by the window lowered his paper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
not going to have a walk over, so don&rsquo;t let us think
we are.&rdquo; For a reason he could not have explained
had his life depended on it, William Hollis revealed
his presence and plunged horse, foot and artillery into
the matter in hand.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="XV">XV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">J</span>OSIAH gave him a look. But it was not the look
he might have expected to receive. It was less the
look of a vindictive parent and employer than the gesture
a Chamberlain might have bestowed on a Jesse
Collings or a Gladstone on a John Morley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, my lad&mdash;not a walk over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a few minutes these great men talked on and
William Hollis by sheer force of some innate capacity,
now first brought to life in the stress of an overwhelming
affair, talked with them as an equal. These were
proud moments in which the power of vision, the understanding
heart seemed to come by their own. The
world was on fire, and if the flames were to be brought
under control many estimates must be revised, many
standards must go by the board. Self-preservation,
the primal instinct, was already uppermost. Brains,
foresight, mental energy were at a premium now.
Any man, no matter who or what he might be, who
had it in him to contribute to the common stock was
more than welcome to do so. The conflagration had
only just begun but a new range of ideas was already
rife. Men were no longer taken on trust, institutions
no longer accepted at their face value.</p>

<p>But all too soon for William Hollis the proceedings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>came to an end. He would have liked to sit there all
night, tossing the ball among his peers, listening politely
and now and again throwing in a word. Suddenly,
however, the door of the private bar opened and
a flaming-haired, shirt-sleeved appearance in a green
baize apron abruptly thrust in its head. At the sight
of the grandees it was thrust out again even more
abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That George?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go out and step that there Bus.&rdquo; In the command
of Josiah was all the power of the man of privilege,
the almost superhuman authority of a city alderman.
Bill Hollis, who had once worn the green apron himself,
was thrilled by the recollection that even in his
day, when Josiah was first elected to the town council,
the public vehicle plying for hire between Jubilee Park
and the Market Place was always at the beck and call
of Mr. Councilor Munt. Few had a good word for
him, but even in those days in that part of the city
his word was law.</p>

<p>Josiah rose and his friends rose with him. But as
he moved to the door he turned a dour eye upon Bill
Hollis. Whole volumes were in it, beyond tongue or
pen to utter. To-night even he, in the stress of what
was happening to the world in which he had prospered
so greatly, was less than himself and also more.
An eye of wary truculence pinned the ex-barman to
the wainscot while the master of the house uttered his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>slow, unwilling growl. &ldquo;Not a bad bloom ye sent in,
my lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a very big dog to a very little dog, but somehow
it told far more than was intended. Almost in
spite of himself, the man who on a day had abused
the confidence of his master by marrying his eldest
daughter was forced to realize that no matter what
Josiah Munt might be, he was ... well, he was Jannock!</p>

<h2 id="XVI">XVI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>WENTY minutes later William Hollis, feeling
inches taller, and more in harmony with himself
than for many a day, went forth to grapple with
the situation in Europe.</p>

<p>Half Blackhampton, at least, if its streets meant
anything, was bent on a similar errand. From every
part of the city, its people were slowly filtering in twos
and threes to the Great Market Place, that nodal point
of the local life and of the life of the empire. Blackhampton
claims to be the exact center of England,
speaking geographically, and its position on the map
is reflected in its mental outlook. It combines a healthy
tolerance for the ways and ideas of places less happily
situated with a noble faith in itself. Time and again
history has justified that faith; time and again it has
chosen the famous town as the scene of a memorable
manifestation, as its castle, its churches, its ancient
buildings, its streets and monuments bear witness.
Here an ill-starred king declared war on his people,
here a great poet was born, to give but a single deed
and a single name among so much that has passed into
history. Many of its sons have shed luster on their
birthplace. Here is a street bearing the name of one
who revolutionized industry; yonder the humble abode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>of the prizefighter who gave his name to one of the
most important towns of Australia; over there the obscure
conventicle of the plain citizen who founded a
world religion; &ldquo;up yond&rdquo; the early home of one
whose name is a household word on five continents;
across the road the public house where a famous athlete
has chosen to live in a modest but honored retirement.</p>

<p>Biologists say that all forms of organic life are
determined by climate. Blackhampton owed much, no
doubt, to its happy situation as the exact center of
the Empire, but no city in the kingdom could have
lived more consciously in that fact. London was not
without importance as places went; the same might be
said for New York; but in the eyes of the true Blackhamptonian,
after all, these centers of light were comparatively
provincial.</p>

<p>This evening the streets of the city were alive with
true Blackhamptonians. In the sight of these only
Blackhampton mattered. Its attitude was of decisive
consequence in this unparalleled crisis. No matter
what other places were doing and thinking, Blackhampton
itself was fully determined to pull its weight
in the boat.</p>

<p>The press of citizens was very great by the time
Bill Hollis arrived in the Market Place. In particular,
they were gathered in serious groups before the
City Hall, the Imperial Club and the offices of the
Blackhampton <i>Tribune</i>, which continued to emit hourly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>editions of the <i>Evening Star</i> with fuller accounts of
the proceedings in Parliament and the latest telegrams
concerning the fighting in Belgium.</p>

<p>The British Cabinet had given Germany until midnight,
but Blackhampton had fully made up its mind
in the matter by five minutes past nine, which was the
precise hour that Mr. William Hollis arrived to bear
his part in the local witenagemot. His part was the
relatively humble one of standing in front of the
Imperial Club and gazing with rather wistful eyes
into that brightly tiled and glazed and highly burnished
interior as it was momentarily revealed by the
entrance of a member.</p>

<p>Even so early in the world&rsquo;s history as five minutes
past nine it was known to those privileged sons of the
race who had assembled in front of the sandstone and
red brick façade of the Blackhampton Imperial Club
that Germany &ldquo;was going to get it in the neck.&rdquo; There
must be a limit to all things and Germany had already
exceeded it. The Cabinet having unluckily
omitted to provide itself with even one Blackhampton
man was yet doing its best to keep pace with informed
Blackhampton opinion, but events were moving very
quickly in front of the Imperial Club. At a quarter
past nine Sir Reuben Jope, the chairman of <i>the</i> Party,
drove up in his electric brougham, a bearded fierce-eyed
figure whose broadcloth trousers allied to a prehistoric
box hat seemed to make him a cross between
a rather aggressive Free Kirk elder and an extraor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>dinarily
respectable pirate. At twenty minutes past
nine Mr. Whibley, the Club porter, an imposing vision
in pale brown, gold braid, and brass buttons, came
down the steps and informed a friend on the curb
&ldquo;that the Fleet was fully mobilized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other luminaries continued to arrive. It was like
the night of a very hotly contested election, except
for the fact that every one of the thousands of human
beings thronging the Market Place were of one
mind. But there was neither boasting nor revelry.
This was a sagacious, a keen-bitten, a practical race.
A terrible job was on hand, but it was realized already
that it would have to be done. The thing had
gone too far. There were no demonstrations; on the
contrary, a quietude so intense as to seem unnatural
gave the measure and the depth of Blackhampton&rsquo;s
feeling upon the subject.</p>

<p>Had Bill Hollis used the forty-one years of his life
in a way to justify his early ambitions he would have
been inside the Club on this historical evening, sitting
on red leather and smoking a cigar with the best of
them. As it was he had to be content with a foremost
place in the ever-growing throng outside the Club
portals, from which point of vantage he was able to
witness the arrival of many renowned citizens and
also to gaze through the famous bow window which
abutted on to the Square at the array of notables
within. In the intensity of the hour the Club servants
had omitted to draw down the blinds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>At ten minutes to ten Mr. Alderman Munt, sustained
by roast saddle of mutton and green peas, fruit
tart and custard, appeared in the embrasure with a
large cigar. Seen from the street he looked a tremendously
imposing figure. Even in the midst of the
men of light and leading who surrounded him he was
a Saul towering among the prophets. Not even his
admirers, and in the city of his birth these were singularly
few, ventured to call him genial, but there was
power, virility, unconscious domination in the far flung
glance that marked the press beyond the Club
windows. Somehow there was a bulldog look about
him that was extraordinarily British. Somehow he
looked a good man in a tight place and a bad one to
cross.</p>

<p>Had the question been asked there was not one
among that throng of hushed spectators who could
have explained his own presence in the Market Place,
nor could he have said just what he was doing there.
A powerful magnet had drawn the many together into
a limited space on an airless evening in August to
gaze at one another and to wonder what was going
to happen, yet well knowing that nothing could happen
as far as that evening was concerned. But in
this strange gathering, in the solemn hush that came
upon it from time to time, was the visible evidence
that the people of Blackhampton were standing together
in a supreme moment. Perhaps it gave a feeling
of security that each was shoulder to shoulder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>with his neighbor in this hour so fateful for themselves,
for Blackhampton, for the human race.</p>

<p>Nothing happened, yet everything happened. The
throng grew denser inside and outside the Imperial
Club, but casual remarks became even less frequent,
newsboys ceased to shout, and presently the hour of
midnight boomed across the square from the great
clock on the Corn Exchange and from many neighboring
steeples. Nothing happened. But it was
Wednesday, August the fifth. The silent multitude
began slowly to disperse. A new phase had opened
in history.</p>

<p>It was not until a quarter past one, by which time
four-fifths of the crowd had gone away as quietly as
it had assembled, that Bill Hollis slowly made his
way home to Love Lane. In his hand was the prize
he had so unexpectedly gained, wrapped in the <i>Evening
Star</i>, but somehow the Show and all the other
incidents of a crowded, memorable, even glorious day
seemed very far off as his boots echoed along the narrow
streets. An imaginative man in whom psychic
perception was sometimes raised to a high power, he
was oppressed by a stealthy sense of disaster. It was
as if an earthquake had shaken the world from pole
to pole. It was as if all the people in it were a little
dizzy with a vibration they could hardly feel which
yet had shivered the foundations of society.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>LACKHAMPTON was in the war from the first
moment. Never its custom to do things by
halves, this body of clear thinking Britons did its best
to rise to the greatest occasion in history. Its best
was not enough&mdash;nothing human could have been&mdash;but
as far as it went it was heroic.</p>

<p>In the first days of the disaster none could tell its
magnitude. Forces had been set in motion whose colossal
displacement was beyond human calculation.
Something more than buckets of water are required
to cope with a prairie fire, but at first there seemed
no other means at hand of dealing with it.</p>

<p>Within the tentative and narrow scope of the machinery
provided by the state wonders were performed
in the early weeks of the holocaust. Every bucket the
country could boast was called into use, but the flames
seemed always to gain in power and fury.</p>

<p>From the outset this midland city, like the kingdom
itself, betrayed not a sign of panic. In the presence
of fathomless danger it remained calm. British
nerves lie deep down, and in those first shattering
weeks the entire nation stood stolidly to its guns under
the threat of night and disruption.</p>

<p>The energy shown by Blackhampton in organizing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>hospitals and in raising men to fill them was truly
amazing, yet in this it was no more than the mirror
of the whole country. City vied with city, shire vied
with shire, in voluntary service to a state, that, no
matter what its defects, was able to maintain a sense
of proportion which may be claimed as the common
measure of the republic. The curious anachronism,
magniloquently miscalled the British Empire, rose at
once to a moral height without a precedent in the history
of the world. It would have been fatally easy in
the circumstances of the case for a brotherhood of
free peoples to have turned a deaf ear to the voice
of honor. The mine was sprung so quickly, the issues
at stake were so cunningly veiled, that only &ldquo;a decent
and a dauntless people,&rdquo; unprepared as they were and
taken by surprise, would have cast themselves into
the breach at an hour&rsquo;s notice, fully alive to the nature
of the act and by a divine instinct aware of its
necessity, yet without fully comprehending what it
involved.</p>

<p>Governments and politicians, like books and writers,
exist to be criticized, and it is their common misfortune
that impudence is now the first function of
wisdom. History is not likely to deny the great part
played in a supreme moment by certain brave and enlightened
men. In the end the mean arts of the party
journal will not rob of their need those who have made
still possible a decent life.</p>

<p>Within a fortnight of the outbreak arose a crying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>need for men. Few, even at that moment, were bold
enough to breathe the word &ldquo;conscription.&rdquo; Britain
was a maritime power. Armies on the Continental
scale were none of her business. Russia and France
bred to European conditions, with a fundamental man
power fully equal to that of the Central Empires could
be trusted to hold their own. But these fallacies were
soon exposed.</p>

<p>Still, even then, the country hesitated to take the
plunge. Conscription seemed to many the direct negation
of what it had stood for in the past. These still
pinned their faith to the system of voluntary levies.
The rally of the country&rsquo;s manhood to a cause only
indirectly its own was beyond all precedent. Field
Marshal Viscount Partington mobilized his very best
mop and sent it to deal with the Atlantic. For all
that the flood did not subside and it gradually dawned
on the public mind that more comprehensive methods
might be needed.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Hun was at the gate of Paris.
The Channel ports, if not actually in the hands of
the enemy, were as good as lost. Belgium was being
ground under the heel of a savage conqueror. And
in the city of Blackhampton, as elsewhere in Britain,
these things made a very deep impression.</p>

<p>Among the many forcible men that a new world
phase revealed Blackhampton to possess, none stood
out more boldly in those first grim weeks than Josiah
Munt. The proprietor of the Duke of Wellington
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>was a man of peculiar gifts, and it was soon only too
clear that not only Blackhampton, but England herself,
had need of them. His was the ruthless energy
that disdains finesse. It sees what to do, or believes
it does&mdash;almost as important in life as we know it!&mdash;and
goes straight ahead and gets it done.</p>

<p>One evening in the middle of September Josiah
came home to dinner in a very black mood. It was
not often that he yielded to depression. But he had
had a hard day on local war committees in the course
of which he had been in contact with men nearer to
the center of things than he was himself. Moreover,
these were men from whom this shrewd son of the
midlands was only too ready to learn. They were
behind the scenes. Sources of information were open
to them which even a Blackhampton alderman might
envy; and they were far from echoing the airy optimism
of the public press. The fabric of society, stable
but elastic, by means of which Josiah himself and so
many like him had been able in the course of two or
three decades to rise from obscurity to a certain power
and dignity was in urgent danger. The whole of the
western world was in the melting pot. That which
had been could never be again. Cherished institutions
were already in the mire. And all this was but
the prelude to a tragedy of which none could see the
end.</p>

<p>Josiah&rsquo;s mood that evening was heavy. Even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>presence at the meal of his sister-in-law, as a rule a
natural tonic, did little to lighten it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t get Paris now,&rdquo; she affirmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo; He shook his head with
the gesture of a tired man. &ldquo;Nobody knows it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Miss Preston read in
that somber manner the need for mental readjustment.
&ldquo;But the papers say that General Joffre has
the situation in hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah renounced a plate of mutton broth only half
consumed. &ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t believe a word you see in the
papers, my gel. They don&rsquo;t know much, and half of
what they do know they are not allowed to tell.&rdquo;
Miss Preston discreetly supposed that it was so. &ldquo;But
things are going better, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hope they are.&rdquo; Josiah&rsquo;s fierce attack upon
the joint in front of him seemed to veto the subject.</p>

<p>The silence that followed was broken by Maria,
whose entrance into the conversation was quite unexpected
and rather startling. &ldquo;Did you know,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;that Melia&rsquo;s husband has joined the army?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah suspended operations to poise an interrogatory
carving knife. &ldquo;Who tells you that?&rdquo; he said
frostily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy from Murrell&rsquo;s, the greengrocer&rsquo;s,&rdquo;&mdash;somehow
the infrequent voice of Maria had an odd
precision&mdash;&ldquo;said to Alice this morning that he heard
that Mr. Hollis had gone for a soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah returned to the joint, content for the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>being with the remark, &ldquo;that it was a bad lookout for
the Germans,&rdquo; a sally that won a timely laugh from
his sister-in-law. On the other hand, Maria, who had
never been known to laugh at anything in all her
anxious days, began to wonder somberly whether
Melia would be able to carry on the business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From all that I hear,&rdquo; growled Josiah, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t
a sight o&rsquo; business to be carried on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the silence which followed Maria gave a sniff
that was slightly lachrymose, and then the strategic
Gerty after a veiled glance towards the head of the
table, ventured on &ldquo;Poor Amelia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah was in the act of giving himself what he
called &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s helping&rdquo; of beans. &ldquo;She made her
own bed,&rdquo; he said in a tone that gained in force by
not being forcible, &ldquo;and now she&rsquo;s got to lie in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time in many years, however, Maria
seemed to be visited by a spark of spirit. &ldquo;Well, I
think it&rsquo;s credible of that Hollis, very creditable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah raised a glass of beer to the light with a
connoisseur&rsquo;s disparagement of its color, and then he
said, &ldquo;In my opinion he&rsquo;s running away from his
creditors. I hear he owes money all round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to risk his life, though,&rdquo; ventured Aunt
Gerty. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;if he risks it,&rdquo; Josiah reluctantly allowed.</p>

<p>Maria became so tearful that she was unable to continue
her dinner.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XVIII">XVIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE next morning, about a quarter to ten, Josiah
boarded a Municipal tram at the foot of The
Rise, earning in the process the almost groveling respect
of its conductor, and paid twopence for a journey
to Love Lane. Five doors up on the left was a
meager house that had been converted into a greengrocer&rsquo;s
shop. By far the most imposing thing about
it was a signboard, which, although sadly in need of
a coat of paint, boldly displayed the name William
Hollis Fruiterer, in white letters on a black ground.
For the last sixteen years, whenever the proprietor
of the Duke of Wellington had occasion to pass this
eyesore which was clearly visible from the busy main
thoroughfare that ran by the end of the street, he
made it a fixed rule to look the other way. But this
morning when he got off the tram car at the corner,
he set his teeth, faced the signboard resolutely and
walked slowly towards it.</p>

<p>A stately thirty seconds or so of progress brought
him to the shop itself. For a moment he stood looking
in the window, which was neither more nor less
than that of a visibly unprosperous greengrocer in a
very small way of business. He then entered a rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>moribund interior, the stock in trade of which consisted
in the main of baskets of potatoes and carrots
and an array of stale cabbages laid in a row on the
counter.</p>

<p>The shop had no one in it, but the first step taken
by an infrequent customer across its threshold rang
a bell attached to the underside of a loose board in
the floor, thereby informing a mysterious entity beyond
a glass door draped with a surprisingly clean
lace curtain that it was required elsewhere.</p>

<p>The entity did not immediately respond to Josiah&rsquo;s
heavy-footed summons. When it did respond it was
seen to be that of a thin faced, exceedingly unhappy
looking woman of thirty-five whose hair was beginning
to turn gray. Her print dress, much worn but
scrupulously clean and neat, had its sleeves rolled
back beyond the elbows; and this fact and a coarse
sackcloth apron implied that she had been interrupted
in the task of scrubbing the floor of the back premises.</p>

<p>The interior of the shop was rather dark and Josiah,
having taken up a position in its most sunless corner,
was not recognized at once by his eldest daughter.</p>

<p>They stood looking at each other, not knowing what
to say or how to carry themselves after a complete
estrangement of sixteen years. Josiah, however, had
taken the initiative; he was a ready-witted man of
affairs and he had been careful to enter the shop with
a formula already prepared to his mind. It might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>or might not bridge the gulf, but in any case that did
not greatly matter. He had not come out of a desire
to make concessions; he was there at the call of duty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They tell me your man&rsquo;s joined th&rsquo; army.&rdquo; That
was the formula, but it needed speaking. And when
spoken it was, after a moment uncannily tense, it was
not as Alderman Munt J.P. had expected and intended
to utter it. Instead of being quite impersonal, the tone
and the manner were rude and grim. Somehow they
had thrown back to an earlier phase of autocratic parenthood.</p>

<p>Melia turned very white. It did not seem possible
for her to say anything beyond a defiant &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Breathing
hard, she stood looking stonily at her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did he go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday.&rdquo; The tone of Melia was queerly like
his own.</p>

<p>Josiah rolled the scrub of whisker under his chin
between his thumb and forefinger, and then slowly
transferred the weight of his ponderous body from
one massive foot to the other. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to be
doing much trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much.&rdquo; But the tone of Melia rather implied
that it was none of his business even if such
was the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will ye be able to carry on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia didn&rsquo;t know. Her father didn&rsquo;t either. He
was inclined to think not, but without expressing that
opinion he stood with narrowed eyes and pursing his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>lips somberly. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the books?&rdquo; he said abruptly.</p>

<p>The desire uppermost in Melia was to tell him in
just a few plain words that the books were no concern
of his and that she would be much obliged if
he would go about his own affairs. But for some
reason she was not able to do so. She was no longer
afraid of him; years ago she had learned to hate and
despise him; but either she was not strong enough,
not a big enough character to be openly rude to him,
or the subtle feelings of a daughter, long since rejected
and forgotten, may have intervened. For after
a horrible moment, in which devils flew round in her,
she said impassively, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not books! Don&rsquo;t keep books!&rdquo; The man of affairs
caught up the admission and treated it almost
as a young bull in a paddock might have treated a
red parasol. &ldquo;Never heard the like!&rdquo; He cast a truculent
glance round the half denuded shop. &ldquo;No wonder
the jockey has to make compositions with his creditors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia flushed darkly. She would have given much
had she been able at that moment to order this father
of hers out of the shop, but every minute now seemed
to bring him an increasing authority. The Dad, the
tyrant and the bully whom she had feared, defied and
secretly admired, was now in full possession. At bottom,
sixteen years had not changed him and it had
not changed her. Had the man for whom she had
wrecked her life had something of her father&rsquo;s qual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>ity
she might have forgiven his inefficiency, his tragic
failure as a human being, or at any rate have been
more able to excuse herself for an act which, look
at it as one would, was simply unforgivable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo; Her hard voice
trembled and then broke harshly&mdash;but anger and defiance
could not go beyond that. &ldquo;He paid the quarter&rsquo;s
rent before he went. He owes a few pounds but
he&rsquo;s going to send me a bit every week until it&rsquo;s paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve got a list of his liabilities.&rdquo; Even
his voice shook a little, but he treated the scorn, the
anger, the hard defiance in her eyes as if they were
not there.</p>

<p>Again the paramount desire was to insult this father
of hers, had it been humanly possible to do so. But
again was she bereft of the power even to make the
attempt. &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; she said sullenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see it, gel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For nearly a minute she stood biting her lips and
looking at him, while for his part he coolly surveyed
the shop in all its miserable inadequacy. She still
wanted to order him out. His proprietary air enraged
her. Yet she could not repress a sneaking admiration
for it and that enraged her even more. But
she suddenly gave up fighting and retired in defeat to
the mysterious region beyond the curtained door,
whence she returned very soon with a piece of paper
in her hand.</p>

<p>Josiah impressively put on his gold-rimmed eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>glasses,
a recent addition to his greatness, and examined
the paper critically. The amount of William
Hollis&rsquo;s indebtedness, declared in hurried, rather illiterate
pencil, as if the heart of the writer had not
been in his task, came to rather less than twenty
pounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This the lot?&ldquo; He spoke as if he had a perfect
right to ask the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Her eyes and her voice contested the right,
yet in spite of themselves they admitted it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who owns this here property?&rdquo; Again the half
truculent glance explored every nook and cranny of
the meager premises.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatmore the builder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah rubbed a thick knuckle upon his cheek.
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; That was his only comment. &ldquo;Owns the row,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia supposed he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What rent do you pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five.&rdquo; She resented the question, but the
growing magnetism of having again a real live man
to deal with was making her clay in his hands.</p>

<p>He took a step to the shop door, the paper still in
his hand, and stood an instant looking up the dreary
length of narrow street. It was only an instant he
stood there, but it was long enough to enable him to
make up his mind. Suddenly he swung round on his
heel to confront the still astonished and resentful
Melia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Want more window space,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Casement
ought to be lower and larger. Those flowers&rdquo;&mdash;he
pointed to a bowl of stocks on the counter&mdash;&ldquo;ought to
be where people can look at &rsquo;em. But this isn&rsquo;t a
neighborhood for flowers. Offer vegetables and fruit
at a low price, but more shop room&rsquo;s needed so that
folks can see &rsquo;em and so that you can buy in bigger
quantities. Who is your wholesaler?&rdquo; He looked
down the list. &ldquo;Coggins, eh? Coggins in the Market
Place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia nodded. Should she tell him that Coggins
had that morning refused to supply anything else until
the last delivery of potatoes, bananas and tomatoes
had been paid for? Pride said no, but a force more
elemental than pride had hold of her now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Owe him six pound, I see. What does he let you
have in the way of credit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t let me have anything else until I&rsquo;ve paid
his account,&rdquo; said the reluctant Melia. &ldquo;And he says
it&rsquo;s all got to be cash for the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did he say that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just been up to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you pay him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised him two pounds by Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah made no comment. Once more his eyes made
the tour of the shop. And then he said with the slow
grunt that Melia knew so well:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very creditable to your man to join up ... if he
sticks it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The four last little words were almost sinister.
And then in the unceremonious way in which he had
entered the shop the great man walked out. The place
was as distasteful to him as his presence in it was
distasteful to his eldest daughter. Yet for both, and
in spite of themselves, their meeting after long years
had had an extraordinary grim fascination.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XIX">XIX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>T Christmas Private Hollis was granted forty-eight
hours&rsquo; leave. He had been a member of
the Blackhampton Battalion rather less than three
months, but this was a piece of luck for which he felt
very grateful.</p>

<p>Those three months had been a grueling time. His
age was forty-one, and, in order to comply with the
arbitrary limit of thirty-eight imposed by Field Marshal
Viscount Partington in the first days of strife,
it had been necessary to falsify his age. Many another
had done likewise. Questions were not asked,
and if a man had physical soundness and the standards
of measurement demanded by the noble Viscount
there seemed no particular reason why they should
be. All the same the sudden and severe change from
a soft life found some weak places in Private Hollis.</p>

<p>How he stuck it he hardly knew. Many a time in
those trying early weeks he was sorely tempted to
go sick with &ldquo;a pain in his hair.&rdquo; But ever at the back
of his mind hovered the august shade of Troop Sergeant
Major William Hollis, the distinguished kinsman
who had fought at Waterloo, whose spurs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>sword hung in the little back sitting room of Number
Five, Love Lane; and that old warrior simply would
not countenance any such proceeding. Therefore,
Christmas week arrived without Private Hollis having
missed a single parade. Although not one of the
bright boys of the Battalion, he was not looked upon
unfavorably, and on Christmas Eve, about four
o&rsquo;clock, he returned to his home from the neighboring
town of Duckingfield.</p>

<p>His home in the course of the sixteen years he had
lived in it had brought him precious little in the way
of happiness. More than once he had wondered if
ever he would be man enough to break its sinister
thrall; more than once he had wished to end the ever-growing
aversion of man and wife by doing something
violent. He had really grown to hate the place.
And yet after an absence of less than three months he
was returning to it with a thankfulness that was surprising.</p>

<p>All the same he was not sure how Melia would receive
him. When at last he had made the great decision
and had told her that he was going to join up
he had said she must either carry on the business in
his absence, or that it could be wound up and she must
be content with the separation allowance. Her answer
had been a gibe. However, she proposed to
carry on in spite of the fact that W. Hollis Fruiterer
as a means of livelihood was likely to prove a stone
about her neck. Still there was a pretty strong vein
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>of independence in her and if she could keep afloat by
her own exertions she meant to do so.</p>

<p>During his three months&rsquo; absence in camp their correspondence
had been meager; it had also been formal,
not to say cold. The estrangement into which they
had drifted was so wide that even the step he had
recently taken could not bridge it. He had told her
on a picture postcard with a view of Duckingfield
Parish Church that he was quite well and he hoped
that she was and that things were going on all right;
and with a view of the Market Place she replied that
she was glad to know that he was quite well as it left
her at present. However, he was careful to supplement
this marital politeness with a few words every
Saturday when he sent her five shillings, all he could
spare of his pay. The money was always acknowledged
briefly and coldly. No clew was given to her
feelings, or to her affairs, but when he told her he
was coming home at Christmas for two days she
wrote to say that she would be pleased to see him.</p>

<p>As he stepped off the tram into the raw Blackhampton
mirk which awaited him at the end of Love
Lane that formal phrase came rather oddly into his
mind. It gave him a sort of consolation to reflect that
Melia was one who said what she meant and meant
what she said. But, whether or not she would be
pleased to see him at the present moment, he was genuinely
pleased to be seeing her.</p>

<p>It was strange that it should be so. But Melia with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>all her grim humors stood for freedom, a life of physical
ease and cushioned independence, and this was
what a slack fibered man of one and forty simply
longed for after three months&rsquo; &ldquo;grueling.&rdquo; For a man
past his physical best, of slothful habits and civilian
softness, the hard training had not been child&rsquo;s play.
Besides, his home meant something. It always had
meant something. That was why in the face of many
difficulties he had struggled in his spasmodic way to
keep it together. It had seemed to give him no pleasure,
it had seemed to bring nothing into his life, but
somehow he had felt that if once he let go of it, as
far as he was concerned it would mean the end of all
things. He would simply fall to pieces. He would
sink into the gutter and he would never be able to
rise again.</p>

<p>Getting off the tram at the end of Love Lane he felt
a sensation that was almost pride to think that he had
a place of his own to come home to. After all it stood
for sixteen years of life and struggle. And at that
moment he was particularly glad that he had sent that
five shillings a week regularly. Unless he had done
so he would not now have been able to go and face
Melia.</p>

<p>There was not much light in the little street, but
it was not yet quite dark. And the first sight of his
home gave him a shock. The outside of the shop had
changed completely. Not only was the signboard and
the rest of the woodwork resplendent with new paint,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>but the window was more than twice the size it had
been. Moreover it was brilliantly lighted; there was
a fine display of apples, oranges, prunes, nuts, even
boxes of candied fruits and bonbons; and in the center
of this amazing picture was a large Christmas tree,
artfully decorated, in a pot covered with pink paper.</p>

<p>William Hollis gave a gasp. And then a slow chill
spread over him as he realized the truth. Somebody
had taken over the business, somebody with capital,
brains, business experience. But that being the case
why had Melia kept it all so dark? And why, if the
business belonged to somebody else, was his name
still on the signboard? And why had it had that new
coat of paint?</p>

<p>The sheer unexpectedness struck him internally, as
if a bucket of water had been dashed in his face. It
was the worst set-back he had ever had in his life.
Not until that moment did he realize how much the
shop meant to him. He was bitterly angry that such
a trick had been played. It showed, as hardly anything
else could have done, the depth of Melia&rsquo;s venom;
it showed to what a point she was prepared to
carry her resentment.</p>

<p>It took him a minute to pull himself together, and
then he walked into the shop, not defiantly, not angrily,
but with a sense of outrage. There was nobody
in it, but, as he cast round one indignant glance at its
new and guilty grandeur and then crossed heavily to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>the curtained door, he held himself ready to meet the
new proprietor.</p>

<p>Beyond that mysterious portal the small living room
was very spick and span. Almost to his surprise he
found Melia there. She matched the room in appearance
and at the moment he came in she was putting a
log of wood on the fire. Great Uncle William&rsquo;s sword
and accouterments, hanging from the wall, were decorated
with holly, the pictures also and a new grocer&rsquo;s
almanac, and a small bunch of mistletoe was suspended
from the gas bracket in the middle of the
ceiling. Everything was far more cheerful and homelike
than he ever remembered to have seen it. The
note of Christmas was there, which in itself meant
welcome and good cheer.</p>

<p>He stood at the threshold of the curtained door, a
neat soldierlike figure with a chastened mustache,
looking wonderfully trim and erect in his uniform.
She greeted him with a kind of half smile on her hard
sad face, but he didn&rsquo;t offer to kiss her. Not for long
years had they been on those terms; they were man
and wife in hardly more than name. And if in his
absence, as there was reason to suspect, she had played
him a trick in revenge for her years of disappointment,
he somehow felt man enough at that moment to make
an end of things altogether so far as she was concerned.
There were faults on both sides, no doubt.
Perhaps he hadn&rsquo;t quite played jannock; but if the
business now belonged to somebody else, he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>simply walk straight out of the place and he would
never enter it again.</p>

<p>She stood looking at him, as if she expected him to
speak first. But he didn&rsquo;t know what to say to her,
with that doubt in his mind. Braced by the stern
discipline which he felt already had made him so
much more a man than he had ever been in his life, he
had come home fully prepared to make a fresh start.
In spite of her embittered temper, he had not lost quite
all his affection for her. He was the kind of man who
craves for affection; absence and hardship had made
him realize that. He had looked forward to this
homecoming, not merely as a relief from the grind of
military routine, which galled him at times so that
he could hardly bear it, but as an assertion of the
manhood, of the husbandhood, that had long been
overdue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evenin&rsquo;, Melia,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evenin&rsquo;, Bill,&rdquo; as she spoke she dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy Christmas to you.&rdquo; Somehow his voice
sounded much deeper than ever before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same to you. Bill.&rdquo; There was almost a softness
in the fall of the words that took his mind a long way
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How goes it?&rdquo; Her reception was thawing him a
little in spite of himself, but he hesitated about taking
off his overcoat. If this fair seeming was intended
to mask a blow there was only one way to meet it.
There was a pause and then he took the plunge. &ldquo;Busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>ness
good?&rdquo; He held himself ready for the consequences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty fair.&rdquo; The tone told nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to be that,&rdquo; he said mordantly. &ldquo;Had a
coat o&rsquo; paint, I see, outside.&rdquo; He steeled himself
again. &ldquo;Had a new window put in an&rsquo; all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you manage it?&rdquo; Again the plunge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got a new landlord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ha! they were coming to it now. He held himself
tensely. &ldquo;Old Whatmore gone up the spout or something?&rdquo;
He remembered that some time back there
had been rumors of an impending bankruptcy on the
part of Whatmore the builder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Whatmore&rsquo;s all right, but he&rsquo;s sold this shop
and the whole row with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sold it, eh?&rdquo; His excitement was so great that
in spite of a cool military air it was impossible to disguise
it. All the same she waited for him to ask the
all-important question, but he was slow to do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s bought it?&rdquo; he said at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s bought it.&rdquo; She did her best to speak
quite casually, but she didn&rsquo;t succeed.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was a knife. Yet it had not dealt exactly the
kind of blow that he had looked for. Even if the
stab was softer, and of that at the moment he was
not quite sure, undoubtedly there was poison in the
wound. In a flash he saw that, somehow, it had
strengthened her position and weakened his. &ldquo;You
never told me he&rsquo;d bought the business.&rdquo; The tone
was a confession of impotence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t bought it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, in face of the facts, the fine exterior and the
large and expensive stock this was a quibble and it was
too palpable. &ldquo;How did you come by all that stuff
in the window then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s helping me to run it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helping you to run it!&rdquo; His face was a picture
of simple incredulity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He paid up all we owed so that we could start
fair. And he looks in every Monday morning and
tells me what to buy and where to buy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he pay for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does.&rdquo; There was something like pride in her
voice. &ldquo;He pays cash. And I have to keep books&mdash;like
I used to at the Duke of Wellington. Of course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>he&rsquo;s only lending the money. I pay him back at the
end of the month when I balance the accounts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was dumfounded by this precise statement. The
hand of his mean, narrow father-in-law was not recognizable.
Somehow it seemed to alter everything, but
not at once was he able to turn his mind to the new
and unexpected situation.</p>

<p>One thing was clear, however; it would be vain to
resent Josiah&rsquo;s interference. He had bought the property
over their heads and he could do what he liked
with his own. Again Melia had been left in debt and
her husband knew well enough that unless some special
providence had intervened she might not have been
able to carry on. Exactly why Josiah had done as he
had done neither his daughter nor his son-in-law could
fathom. They hated to receive these belated favors,
yet as things were there was no way of escaping them.</p>

<p>A little reluctantly, yet with a feeling of intense relief,
Bill took off his good khaki overcoat and hung it
on the nail provided for the purpose on the curtained
door. Melia toasted a pickelet at the clear fire, buttered
it richly, set it in a dish in the fender to keep warm;
then the kettle began to boil and she brewed the tea.</p>

<p>As she did all this Bill noticed that there was a new
air of alertness, of competence about her; there was a
light in her eyes, a decision in her actions; she seemed
to have more interest in life. And for himself, as he
sat at the table with its clean cloth and shining knives
and spoons and bright sugar bowl and she handed him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>his tea just as he liked it, with one lump of sugar and
not too much milk, he felt something changing in him
suddenly. In a way of speaking it was a kind of rebirth.</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t talk much. Melia was not a talking
sort, nor was he except when he had &ldquo;had a drop,&rdquo; and
he didn&rsquo;t get &ldquo;drops&rdquo; now. Besides, in any case,
the army seemed to have taken anything superfluous
in the way of talk out of him, as it did with most.
But he was honestly glad to be back in the peaceful
four walls of his home. And it was not certain, although
Melia carefully refrained from hinting as
much, that she was not honestly glad to see him there.
At all events she got his slippers for him presently
out of the boot cupboard; and then, unasked, she made
a spill of paper for him and laid it on the table by
his elbow, a sufficient intimation that he was expected
to light his pipe.</p>

<h2 id="XXI">XXI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HEY went to bed at a quarter to ten. For a time
they talked and then Bill fell asleep. And he
slept as perhaps he had never slept in that room in all
the years of their married life. How good the old
four-poster seemed! It was a family heirloom in
which he had been born forty-one and a half years
ago. Many a miserable, almost intolerable night had
he passed in it, but this Christmas Eve in the course
of ten minutes or so it was giving him one of the best
sleeps he had ever known.</p>

<p>He woke in pitch darkness. Melia was breathing
placidly and regularly by his side. He didn&rsquo;t venture
to move lest he should disturb her, and he lay motionless
but strangely comfortable; somehow it had never
given him such exquisite pleasure to lie in that old
bed.</p>

<p>Everything was very still; there was none of the intolerable
fuss and clatter of barrack life at all hours
of the day and night. It was so peaceful that he was
just about to doze again when a distant clock began
to strike. It was the familiar clock of Saint George&rsquo;s
Church, along Mulcaster Road, a hundred yards or so
away, and it told the hour of seven.</p>

<p>Two or three minutes later bells began to ring. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>was Christmas morning; they were proclaiming peace
on earth and good will towards men. How rum they
sounded! Yet as he lay motionless in that bed, with
a slow succession of deeply harmonious breaths near
by, he wished harm to no man, not even to the Boche.
Peace on earth and good will towards men ... yes,
and women! Then it was, just in that pulse of time,
the inspiration came to him to make Christmas morning
memorable.</p>

<p>The idea was very simple. He would steal out of
bed without harm to the slumbers of Melia, slip on
his clothes in the dark, go downstairs, light the kitchen
fire, boil the kettle and presently bring her a cup of
tea. Never before had it occurred to him to pay her
such a delicate attention, but this morning he appeared
to have a new mind and a new heart; somehow,
this morning he was seeing things with other
eyes.</p>

<p>Without disturbing her he was able to carry out
his plan. But twenty minutes later when he returned
to the room with a cup of tea on a small tray, Melia
was awake and wondering what the time was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Needn&rsquo;t get up yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lit the fire.
Happy Christmas to you!&rdquo; Then he handed her the
tea.</p>

<p>She seemed much surprised and just for a moment
a little embarrassed. But she drank the tea gratefully,
yet wondering all the time what had made him
bring it to her. Then she announced her intention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>of getting up, but he bade her lie quiet as it was Christmas
morning and he was well able to cook the breakfast.</p>

<p>Quite a pretty passage of arms developed between
them on the subject, but in the end she prevailed in
spite of his protests, and came downstairs to deal in
person with the vital matter of the bacon and eggs.</p>

<p>Somehow their half playful contention made a good
beginning to the day. And, take it altogether, it was
quite the best they had ever known in that ill-starred
house. There had been times when week had followed
week of such hostility that they had hardly exchanged
a look or a word, times in fact of soul-destroying antipathy
in which they almost loathed the sight of one
another. But there was nothing of that now. So
much had happened in three short months of separation
that there were a hundred things to talk about;
both of them seemed to be living in a different world.</p>

<p>Their outlook on life had altered. Everything they
did now had a purpose, a meaning; it was not merely
a question of getting through a day that had neither
reason nor rhyme. He was a soldier in a uniform,
he felt and looked a man in it, he stood for something.
She was proud, in a way she had never been proud,
of having a husband in the army. It was her duty
and her privilege to keep his home together against
his return to civil life.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast they were visited by a second
inspiration, but this time it came to Melia. Suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>they attended the eleven o&rsquo;clock service at Saint
George&rsquo;s Church? In their early married life they
had gone there together once or twice, but for many
years now when Melia went there on Sunday evenings
she had invariably been alone.</p>

<p>It may have been a desire to let the neighbors see
how well his khaki suited him, or life in the army
had aroused an odd craving for religion, or perhaps it
was simply a wish to give pleasure to Melia; at any
rate Bill fell in with the idea. She had just time to
arrange with the lady next door, Mrs. Griggs by name,
who had once been a cook in good service, to give an
eye to the turkey which was set cooking in the oven,
then to put on her best dress, not much of a best, it
was true, but to have gone to church in any other
would have been unthinkable, to put on her only decent
hat and a sorely mended pair of black cotton
gloves, and to get there on the stroke of eleven, just
as the bells ceased and the choir were moving down
to their stalls. Melia, at any rate, had seldom enjoyed
a service so much as this one, and her friend the
Reverend Mr. Bontine, who called to see her regularly
once a quarter, preached the finest sermon she had
ever heard in the course of long years of worship.</p>

<p>For all that, it was not certain that Private Hollis
was not bored a little by the Reverend Mr. Bontine.
He could not help a yawn in the middle of the homily,
but this may have been a concession to his length of
days as a civilian when &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t hold with persons,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>but as Melia was too much absorbed to notice him, her
sense of a manly and fruitful discourse was not
marred; and she was able to enjoy the same happy
oblivion of martial restiveness during the long prayer.
Taking one consideration with another Private Hollis
may be said to have borne extremely well an ordeal
to which he had not submitted for many years; and
at the end of the service as he came out of church
he grew alive to the fact that in the sight of the congregation
he was a person of far more consequence
than he had ever been in his life.</p>

<p>More than one pair of eyes, once hostile or aloof,
were upon him and also upon Melia. People looked
at him as if they would have been only too proud to
know him, substantial people like Wilmers, the insurance
agent, and Jenkinson the tailor; but the climax
came as he stepped on to the flags of Mulcaster
Road and no less a man than Mr. Blades, the druggist
of Waterloo Square, took off his tall hat to Melia and
said, &ldquo;Happy Christmas to you, Mr. Hollis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A year ago that was an incident that simply could
not have happened. But after all it was just one
among many. He was an equal now with the best of
his neighbors, no matter what their substance and
standing. He was a man who counted. In the Blackhampton
Battalion he was merely Private Hollis, and
not much of a private at that, as many loud voiced
and authoritative people made a point of telling him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>but in civilian circles apparently the outlook was different.</p>

<p>When they turned into Love Lane they were met by
further evidence of the new status of W. Hollis Fruiterer.
A flaming-haired youth in a green baize apron
had been knocking in vain on the shuttered door of the
shop. There was a parcel in his hand whose shape
was familiar but not on that account the less intriguing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mester Munt&rsquo;s compliments&mdash;sir.&rdquo; It was against
the tradition of the green baize apron to indulge the
general public with promiscuous &ldquo;sirs,&rdquo; but, in handing
ceremoniously the parcel to Private Hollis, democracy
in its purest form deferred a little to his martial
aspect.</p>

<p>Bill never felt less in need of his father-in-law&rsquo;s
compliments than at that moment, but the abrupt departure
of George the Barman somehow forced them
upon him. All the same, as Private Hollis fitted the
key into the shop door he wondered what the Old
Swine was up to now.</p>

<p>Divested of its trappings on the sitting room table
the parcel turned out to be a handsome bottle of port
wine. It would not have been human for William
Hollis to remain impervious to this largesse from the
famous cellar of the Duke of Wellington. And he
knew by the screen of cobwebs that it was out of the
sacred corner bin.</p>

<p>Bill was puzzled. What had come over the Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>Pig! However.... With the care of one who knew
the worth of what he handled he put the royal visitor
in the cupboard, among plebeian bottles of stout
and beer, and then proceeded, chuckling rather grimly
at certain thoughts, to help Melia &ldquo;set the dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a modest feast, but when in the course of
time he sat down to carve a roast turkey, a plump and
proper young bird, flanked with sausages and chestnuts,
he informed Melia &ldquo;that he wouldn&rsquo;t give a thank
you to dine with the King of England.&rdquo; She could
not help smiling at this disloyal utterance, which so
ill became his uniform, as she freely ladled out bread
sauce, that purely Anglo-Saxon dainty, for which his
affection amounted almost to a passion, and helped
him hugely to potatoes and Brussels sprouts, so that
it should be no fault of hers if he was unable to plead
provocation for his lapse. Plum pudding followed.
It was of the regulation Blackhampton pattern and
Melia, no mean cook when she gave her mind to it,
had given her mind to this one, so that it expressed
her genius and the festive genius of her native city
in a hearty time of cheer.</p>

<p>At the end of the meal, in spite of the fact that he
was told rather sternly &ldquo;to set quiet,&rdquo; he insisted like
a soldier and a sportsman in helping to clear the table
and in bearing a manly but subordinate part in the
washing up. And when the table had once more assumed
the impersonal red cloth of its hours of leisure,
a couple of wine glasses were produced, which,
al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>though polished twice a week, had not seen active
service for fifteen years, and then William drew the
cork of the cobwebbed bottle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a drop for me, Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to have it, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Fairation!&rdquo; He gave one deep sniff at the
glass he had measured already with a care half reverent,
half comic. &ldquo;By Gum, it&rsquo;s prime.&rdquo; In spite of
protests he poured out another glass. &ldquo;Fairation!
Better drink the health, eh, of the Old Un as it&rsquo;s
Christmas Day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They honored the Old Un discreetly, in a modest
sip of a wine which of itself could not have denied
him a claim to honor, and then with equal modesty
they drank to each other.</p>

<p>Melia then had an inspiration, though not subject to
them as a rule, and due in this case, no doubt, to the
juice of the grape. She procured a plate full of walnuts
from beyond the curtained door and they entered
on a further phase of discreet festivity. Bill
insisted on cracking three nuts and peeling them for
her with his own delicately accomplished fingers; and
in the process he complimented her on the Christmas
fare and hoped piously that &ldquo;the Chaps had had half
as good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mention of the Chaps moved him for the first time
to reminiscence. As was to be expected, the Blackhampton
Battalion was one of the wonders of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>world. To begin with, its members were nearly all
gentlemen. All the nobs of the town under forty were
tommies in the B.B. It was very remarkable that it
should be so, but there the fact was. And it made
men of his sort who liked to think a bit when they
had the time to spare feel regular democratic when
they saw real toffs like Lawyer Mossop&rsquo;s nephew,
Marling the barrister, carting manure, or the son of
Sir Reuben Jope on his knees scrubbing the floor of
the sergeants&rsquo; mess.</p>

<p>To mix in such company was a rare opportunity
for a man who knew how to use it. Melia had noted
already that Bill had learned to express himself better,
that his conversation was at a higher level and that
it was full of new ideas. And these facts were never
so palpable as when, slowly and solemnly, a furtive
light of humor in his blue eyes, he went on to tell of
his great Bloomer.</p>

<p>It seemed that the cubicle next to his was occupied
by a man named Stanning, and he had got to be rather
pals with him. Stanning was a serious sort of cove
with hair turning gray at the temples, but Private
Hollis had been attracted to him because he was one
of the right sort and because it was clear from his talk
that he had thought and seen a bit. He was a good
kind of man to talk to, a sympathetic sort of card,
one of those who made you feel that you had things
in common.</p>

<p>Private Hollis gradually got so &ldquo;thick&rdquo; with Private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>Stanning that they began to discuss things in an intellectual
way, politics one time, education another,
so on and so on, until one evening they found themselves
talking of Art. As Melia knew, Private Hollis
had a feeling for Art. Many an hour had he spent in
the City Museum, looking at its collection of famous
pictures; and he told Private Stanning of the water
color he had done of the Sharrow at Corfield Weir,
inspired by the great work on the same subject of his
celebrated namesake Stanning, R.A., which had been
bought by the City Authorities for the fabulous sum
of a thousand guineas....</p>

<p>Over the walnuts and the wine Private Hollis began
to chuckle hugely as his great Bloomer came back to
his mind in all its entrancing details....</p>

<p>P.H. When I first see the price mentioned in the
<i>Evening Star</i> I says to my Missus that&rsquo;s the way they
chuck public money about. No picture was never
painted, not a Hangelo nor even a Lord Leighton that
was ever worth a thousand guineas. It&rsquo;s a fancy
price.</p>

<p>P.S. &rsquo;Tis in a way. A matter of sentiment, I
suppose.</p>

<p>P.H. Just what I said to the Missus. However,
being a bit of a critic I went to examine that picture
for myself. And would you believe it, Stanning&mdash;I&rsquo;m
not saying this to flatter you because the chap who
done it has the same name as yours&mdash;when I see that
picture it fair knocked me endways. You see I know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>every yard of Corfield Weir; in my time I&rsquo;ve had
more than one good fish out of it; and as soon as I set
eyes on it, I said to myself, &ldquo;Stanning R.A.&rsquo;s a fisherman.
He&rsquo;s chosen one of them gray days that&rsquo;s good
for barbel.&rdquo; I give you my word, he&rsquo;d got just the
proper light coming out of the valley and stealing
along the Sharrow. Only an artist and a fisherman
could have done it.</p>

<p>P.S. Did you ever get bream there?</p>

<p>P.H. I should say so. And I&rsquo;ve had trout in my
time.</p>

<p>P.S. Trout?</p>

<p>P.H. I&rsquo;m talking of twenty years back. But to
resume. I see at a glance why the City Authorities
had paid a thousand guineas for that picture. It was
not because Stanning, R.A., was a local man; it was
pure merit and I felt very glad it was so.</p>

<p>P.S. Glad you thought so.</p>

<p>P.H. You know, of course, that Stanning, R.A.,
is Blackhampton born?</p>

<p>P.S. So I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>

<p>P.H. Born in that old house with the high-walled
garden along Blue Bell Hill that was pulled down to
widen the road.</p>

<p>P.S. That so?</p>

<p>P.H. By the way, Stanning, is he a relation of
yours? Of course, it&rsquo;s a very common name in the
City.</p>

<p>P.S. Ye&mdash;es, I suppose he is in a way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>P.H. That&rsquo;s something to be proud of. I&rsquo;m not
saying it to flatter you, but at this minute I&rsquo;d rather
be Stanning, R.A., than any one else in the wide world.</p>

<p>Private Stanning laughed like a good one.</p>

<p>P.H. Honest. I&rsquo;m not talking out of the back of
my neck. Stanning, R.A., for me. You can have all
my share of the Kitcheners and the Joffres and the
von Klucks. If I could be born again and born somebody
as mattered I&rsquo;d like to be Stanning, R.A. Why,
what the hell are you grinning at?</p>

<p>P.S. That&rsquo;s rheumatism. And if you&rsquo;ll only take
it over, old son, you can have all the remainder of
my interest in Stanning, R.A., as a going concern.</p>

<p>P.H. What! do you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you, Mother,&rdquo; concluded Private Hollis in
his port-wine-inspired narrative, &ldquo;that he was going
gray at the temples. And there he set like a himage
at the foot of his shakedown all twisted with rheumatics,
groaning like one o&rsquo;clock. And then he began
to laugh. Queer world, ain&rsquo;t it, what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia, however, was one of those precise but rather
immobile intellects with which her tight little native
island is full to overflowing. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to
say, Bill, it was Stanning, R.A., himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet your life it was.&rdquo; Private Hollis handed
a peeled walnut, his masterpiece so far, across an expanse
of red tablecloth. &ldquo;One of the youngest R.A.&rsquo;s
on record, but a bit long in the tooth for the Army.
And we&rsquo;re pals, I tell you. One of these days I&rsquo;m
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>going to take him barbel fishing at Gawsey&rsquo;s Pool.
And he&rsquo;s given me a couple of lessons in drawing already.
If only I&rsquo;d begun sooner I think I might have
done something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was such an incredible story that Melia was fain
to smile, but Private William Hollis, inspired by port
wine and enthusiasm, lingered lovingly over his portrait
of one who stood forth in his mind as the greatest
man the city of Blackhampton had yet produced.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XXII">XXII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">F</span>ORTY-EIGHT hours is not a long time even as
time is reckoned in a world war, when the infinitely
much can happen in a little space. Only one-fourth
of that term, a meager twelve hours, was permitted
to Russia by Germany in which to decide
whether she should yield unconditionally to an unheard
of demand, on pain of provoking that conflict,
the end of which even some of the most penetrating
minds in Blackhampton were hardly able to predict
with certainty. So much may happen in a little while.
Yet Private Hollis had just four times as long to re-establish
terms of conjugal felicity with his wife
Melia. In that period he kissed her twice.</p>

<p>Whether that Christian practice would have continued
as a regular thing is difficult to say. This was
a special occasion and these were not demonstrative
natures. Even in the heyday of their romance, when
Love not being quite strong enough to turn the door
handle, peered once or twice through the keyhole, yet
without ever proving quite bold enough to come in
and make himself at home on that childless hearth,
they were too practical to acquire a permanent taste
for that particular kind of nonsense.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>Still, it hardly does to dogmatize in time of war.
For as the forty-eight hours went on, Melia seemed to
grow more and more impressed by Private Hollis, his
martial bearing. Or it may have been the uniform.
Why is it that any kind of uniform has such a fatal
attraction for the ladies?</p>

<p>In this case, at any rate, it seemed to make a remarkable
difference. There is no doubt it suited Bill.
He looked so much more a man in it; his chest was
bigger, his back was straighter, his hair was shorter,
his chin was cleaner and the ragged mustache that
used to be all over his face was now refined to the extreme
point of military elegance. Really he came
much nearer to the ideal of manhood there had been
in Melia&rsquo;s mind when she had first married him. Besides
he was so much surer of himself, his voice was
deeper, his bearing more authoritative, his talk was
salted with infinitely more knowledge and wisdom.</p>

<p>When the time came for Private Hollis to return to
his regiment, the boy who delivered the vegetables
was left in charge of the shop, while Melia in Sunday
attire went to see her man off at the Central Station.
It was a compliment he had hardly looked for; all
the same it was appreciated. Somehow it made a difference.
Other wives, mothers, sisters, sweethearts
were thick on the ground for a similar purpose, but
Private Hollis was of opinion that Melia with her serious
face and a figure you couldn&rsquo;t call stout and in a
hat she had trimmed herself with black and white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>wings was somehow able to hold her own with the
best of them.</p>

<p>Moreover they parted at the carriage door as if they
meant something to each other now. It was a public
place but he kissed her solemnly and she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
write me a bit oftener, Bill, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; in the manner
of the long ago. Then the train began to move,
he waved a hand and she waved hers; and each trundled
back alone to a hard life with its many duties,
yet somehow, in a subtle way, the stronger and the
happier for that brief interregnum.</p>

<p>Life had altered for them both in that short time.
They saw each other with new eyes or perhaps with
old eyes reawakened. Sixteen years had rubbed so
much of the bloom off their romance that it was a
miracle almost that they were able to renew it. Yet
the delicate process was only just beginning. It was
very odd, but the trite and difficult business of existence
was colored now continually with new thoughts
about each other. Neither had ever been a great hand
at writing letters, but Bill suddenly burgeoned forth
into four closely written pages weekly, and Melia,
flattered but not to be outdone, burst out in equal
volume.</p>

<p>His letters were really very interesting indeed and
so were hers, although of course in an entirely different
way. She was kept abreast of the military situation
and the latest Service gossip, with spicy yarns
of the Toffs with whom he rubbed shoulders as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>equal in the B.B., not omitting the details of an ever-ripening
friendship with Private Stanning, who, however,
was soon to acquire the rank of a full corporal.
Melia, of course, had not the advantage of this range
of information or contiguity to high affairs, nor did
her letters sparkle with soldierly flashes of wit and
audacity, but week by week they gave a conscientious
account of the state of the business, of sales and purchases,
of current prices and money outstanding, all
in the manner of a careful bookkeeper, who, now she
had been put on her mettle, was able and willing to
show that the root of the matter was in her.</p>

<p>Bill, in consequence, had to own that the business
in all its luckless history had never been so flourishing.
They didn&rsquo;t like admitting it, but in their hearts
they knew that this new prosperity was directly due
to &ldquo;the damned interference&rdquo; (military phrase) of the
august proprietor of the Duke of Wellington. Some
men are hoo-doos, they are born under the wrong set
of planets; whatever they do or refrain from doing
turns out equally unwise. W. Hollis Fruiterer had always
been one of that kind. If he bought a barrel
of Ribstone Pippins they went bad before he could
sell them, if he bought William pears they refused to
ripen, if he bought peas or runner beans he would have
done better with gooseberries or tomatoes; anything
he stocked in profitable quantities was bound to be
left on his hands. But the lord of Strathfieldsaye was
another kind of man altogether. He simply couldn&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>do wrong when it came to a question of barter. Up
to a point a matter of judgment, no doubt, but &ldquo;judgment&rdquo;
does not altogether explain it. There is a subtle
something, over and beyond all mundane wisdom, that
confers upon some men the Midas touch. Everything
they handle turns to gold. Josiah Munt was notoriously
one of that kind.</p>

<p>Certainly from the day he touched the moribund
business of W. Hollis Fruiterer with his magic wand,
it took a remarkable turn for the better. Mr. Munt&rsquo;s
own explanation of the phenomenon was that for the
first time in its history it was run on sound business
lines. That had something to do with the mystery of
course; not only was Josiah a man of method and
foresight, he was also a man of capital. Money makes
money all the world over; and of that fact Josiah&rsquo;s
ever-growing store was a shining proof.</p>

<p>Not until the middle of the summer did Bill get
leave again. And then there was a special reason
for it. The Battalion had been ordered to France.
That was an epic Saturday evening in July when he
came home with full kit, brown as a bean, hard as
a nail, in rare fighting trim. Time was his own until
the Thursday following, when he had to go to
Southampton to join the Chaps.</p>

<p>Martial his bearing at Christmas, but it was nothing
to what it was now. There seemed to be a consciousness
of power about him. For one thing he was wearing
the stripe of a lance corporal. Then, too, he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>a small man, and, as biologists know, small men always
have a knack of looking bigger than they are
really. Physically speaking, great men are generally
on the small side, perhaps for the reason that they
have more vitality. Certainly Corporal Hollis, on the
eve of his Odyssey, looked more important than the
neighbors ever thought possible. Poor Melia began
to wonder if she would be able to live up to him.</p>

<p>Melia had never been to London and when Bill proposed
that she should accompany him to the metropolis
and see him off from Waterloo the suggestion
came as quite a shock to a conservative nature. It
meant almost as much as a journey to the middle of
Africa or the wilds of the Caucasus to more traveled
people. She was not easily fluttered; hers was a mind
of the slow-moving sort, but it was only after a night
and a day, fraught with grave questionings, that she
finally consented to do so.</p>

<p>For one thing the shop would have to close for
twenty-four hours, at least; besides, and a more vital
matter, even her best dress was nothing like fashionable
enough for London, the capital city of the
empire. Both these objections were promptly overruled.
An obliging neighbor&mdash;during the last few
months the neighbors had proved wonderfully obliging&mdash;consented
to take charge of the shop in Melia&rsquo;s
absence; while at the psychological moment a paragraph
appeared in the <i>Evening Star</i> saying that as
the Best people were making a point of wearing old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>clothes, any attempt at fashion in war time was bad
taste. This interesting fact left so little for further
discussion that at a quarter past nine on the morning
of an ever-memorable Wednesday they steamed out
of Blackhampton Central Station, London bound.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of a day such as Melia had
never known. Looking back upon it afterwards, and
she was to look back upon it many times in the days
to follow, she felt it would have been impossible to
surpass it in sheer human interest. Even the journey
to such a place as London was thrilling to one
whose travels by train had been confined to half a
dozen visits to Duckingfield, two to Matlock Bath and
one to Blackpool at the age of seven, nice places yet
relatively unimportant in comparison with the capital
city of the British Empire.</p>

<p>As the train did not leave for Southampton until
well on in the evening they had about eight hours in
which to see the sights. And so much happened in
those eight hours that they made a landmark in their
lives. Indeed they began with so signal an event that
the muse of history peremptorily demands a past chapter
in which to relate it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XXIII">XXIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>S soon as he arrived in the metropolis, Corporal
Hollis with Melia rather nervously gripping his
arm stepped boldly into the Euston Road to have a
look at London. Almost the first thing he saw was
a Canteen, a token that at once reminded him that
his rifle and kit were heavy, that the wife and he had
breakfasted rather early and rather hurriedly and that
nothing at that moment could hope to compare with
a couple of ham sandwiches and a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>When the question was put to Melia she was inclined
to think so too, although far too bewildered
by the mighty flux around her to give any special
thought to the matter. However very wisely, nay
providentially, as it turned out, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation
they decided to cross the road and follow the
promptings of nature. As they passed through the
inviting doors of the Canteen there was nothing to
tell them that anything particular was going to happen,
yet perhaps they ought to have remembered that
this was London where the Particular is always happening.</p>

<p>They had not to fight their way through a crowd in
order to get in or anything of that sort. Nor were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>people walking on one another&rsquo;s heads when they did
get in. There was plenty of room for all. Full privates
were in the majority, but the non-commissioned
ranks were also represented, among whom was a
Scotsman who had risen to be a sergeant. But Corporal
Hollis appeared to be the only warrior who had
brought his lawful wedded missus. It was a breach
of the rules for one thing, but there was any amount
of room, and he managed to stow her away in a quiet
corner where they could have a table to themselves;
and then he moved across to a cubbyhole where a
nice fatherly old sportsman with side whiskers and
brown spats relieved him of his rifle and kit and gave
him a card with a number in exchange. Then the
gallant Corporal, a composite of well-bred diffidence
and martial mien, sauntered up to the counter at the
end of the room where a Real Smart Piece in a mob
cap and jumper gave him the smile interrogative.
After a moment&rsquo;s survey of the good things around
him, he magnificently went the limit. The limit was
ninepence: to wit, two fried eggs, a rasher of bacon,
bread and butter and a cup of tea; in this case ditto
repeato, once for himself, once for Melia.</p>

<p>The Corporal was by no means sure that the R.S.P.
would stand for a Twicer but she was one of the noble
breed that prefers to use common sense rather than
raise obstacles. After one arch glance in the direction
of Melia she booked the order without demur.</p>

<p>In the process of time the order was executed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>they set to upon this second breakfast with a breadth
of style which almost raised it to the dignity of luncheon.
By the time they were through it was half-past
midday already, and they were discussing this fact
and its bearing on the general program when the great
Event began to happen.</p>

<p>It came about unobtrusively, in quite a casual way.
Neither the Corporal nor his lady paid much attention
at first, but of a sudden the nice fatherly old sportsman
who had relieved the former of his rifle and kit
came out of his cubbyhole and a dashing trio of
R.S.P.&rsquo;s emerged from a mysterious region at the back
of beyond, proving thereby that the counter had no
monopoly of these luxuries, and the Scotch sergeant
moved a pace or two nearer the door, where the London
daylight seemed a bit better in quality, and then
Bill&rsquo;s R.S.P., who was absolutely the pick of the
bunch, although such comparisons are invariably as
idle as they are to be deplored, was heard to use a word
that appeared to rhyme with Mother.</p>

<p>Of course it could not have been Bother or any
word like it. And whatever it may have been, was
not, at that moment, as far as the Corporal and
his lady were concerned, of the slightest importance.
To them it meant nothing. It meant less than nothing.
For a startling rumor was afoot....</p>

<p>The Queen was coming.</p>

<p>William was a military man and fully determined
to bear himself with the coolness of one on parade,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>but his air of stoicism was but a poor cloak to his
feelings. As for Melia, if not exactly <i>flustered</i>, she
was excited more than a little. Still in this epic moment
it was a strengthening thought that she had
had that yard and a half of new ribbon put on her
hat.</p>

<p>That was an instance of subconscious but prophetic
foresight. There was nothing to tell her that
the first lady in the land would nip across from Buckingham
Palace as soon as she heard that Bill was in
London. It was hardly to have been expected. In
the first place it was truly remarkable that she should
so soon have heard of his arrival. And of course it
was by no means certain that this casual and informal
visit of hers was inspired by William. In fact if you
came to think of it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But there was really no time to weigh the pros and
the cons of what after all was a superfluous inquiry,
for a commotion had arisen already beyond the farther
door. And even at this late moment, and in spite of
a general stiffening of the phalanx of R.S.P.&rsquo;s and
other details, and the stately advance of the nice old
warrior through the swing doors into the Euston
Road, even then Corporal Hollis, with true military
skepticism, was not sure that it was not an Oaks.</p>

<p>However the question was soon settled. The commotion
increased, the throng of important looking
people surprisingly grew, and in the midst of it appeared
a lady whom William and Melia would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>known anywhere. She was remarkably like her portraits
except that the reality surpassed them. There
was a great deal of bowing and walking backwards
and the serried rows of R.S.P.&rsquo;s made curtsys, and
then all ranks stood up and removed their hats. William
and Melia stood up too, but only William doffed
his helmet.</p>

<p>It was the Scotsman who claimed the first share
of the august visitor&rsquo;s notice. Her eye lit at once on
this son of Caledonia, who unconsciously, by sheer
force of climate, began to tower above all the rest,
returning answer for question with inimitable coolness
and mastery. All the Saxons present were lost
in envy, but they were fain to acquiesce in the stern
truth that nature has made it impossible to keep back
a Scotsman. In spite of top hats and swallow-tails
it was clear at a glance that he was the best man
there.</p>

<p>All the same the august visitor, helped by a simple
and friendly lady who accompanied her, contrived to
distribute her favors impartially. The son of Caledonia
was so compelling that it would have been a
pleasure to talk to him for an hour, but duty and justice
forbade, and she found a smile and a word for
humbler mortals. Among these, and last of all in
her tour of the large room were Bill and Melia.</p>

<p>Corporal Hollis could not be expected to display
the entrain of a sergeant of the Black Watch. Be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>sides
he had yet to cross the water whereas Caledonia&rsquo;s
son was a hero of Mons and the Marne. But
the gallant corporal did his regiment no discredit in
that great moment, likewise his wife Melia, nor famed
Blackhampton, his fair natal city.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XXIV">XXIV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN about twenty minutes later William and
Melia, haloed with history, emerged from the
precincts of the Canteen, and as they did so treading,
in a manner of speaking, the circumambient air, they
were at once confronted by the spectacle of Bus 49
next the adjacent curb. And Bus 49, according to its
own account of the matter, was going amongst other
places to Piccadilly Circus.</p>

<p>It was the first visit of the Corporal to the metropolis,
but in his mind was lurking the sure knowledge
that Piccadilly Circus was the exact and indubitable
center thereof; and by an association of ideas, he also
seemed to remember that Piccadilly Circus was where
the King lived. Such being the case, the apparition
at that moment of Bus 49 was about as providential
as anything could have been.</p>

<p>It was the work of an instant to get aboard the
gracious engine, so swift the workings of the human
mind in those dynamic moments when Fate itself
appears, as the sailors say, to stand by to go about.
Moreover the conductor had politely informed the
Corporal that there was room for two on the top.</p>

<p>That was a golden journey, a kind of voyage to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>silken Samarcand and cedared Lebanon, allowing of
course for reduction according to scale. So miraculously
were their hearts attuned to venturing, that for
one rapt hour they drank deep of poetry and romance
this glorious midday of July.</p>

<p>Bus 49 knew its business thoroughly, no bus better.
Instead of turning pretty sharp to the left into
that complacent purlieu Portland Place, as a bus of
less experience might have done in order to follow
the line of flight of some mythical crow or other, it
chose to go on and on, past Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s, the
Hotel Great Central, and then by a series of minor
but hardly less historic landmarks along Edgware
Road to the Marble Arch, thence via Park Lane to
Hyde Park Corner.</p>

<p>No doubt Bus 49 had ideas. The ordinary machine
of commerce would have got from Euston to Piccadilly
Circus in two shakes of a duck&rsquo;s tail. Not so
this accomplished metropolitan, this gorgeous midday
of July. From Hyde Park Corner it proceeded to
Victoria, thence via the Army and Navy Stores to the
Houses of Parliament, down Whitehall, past the lions
and Horatio, Viscount Nelson, past the Crédit Lyonnais,
up the Haymarket and so at last to Swan and
Edgar&rsquo;s corner, where William and Melia dismounted,
thrilled as never before in all their lives.</p>

<p>Piccadilly Circus, all the same, was a shade disappointing.
It was not quite so grand as they expected.
The Criterion was just opposite, but they looked in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>vain for the King&rsquo;s residence. There did not appear
to be a sign of that. Bill, however, noticed a policeman,
and decided to make inquiries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want Buckingham Palace, please,&rdquo; said the
wearer of the King&rsquo;s uniform.</p>

<p>Constable X 20, an intelligent officer, told the gallant
corporal to walk along Piccadilly, to which famous
thoroughfare he pointed with professional majesty,
to turn down the street of Saint James, to keep
right on until he got to the bottom and then to ask
again.</p>

<p>The constable was thanked for his lucidity and William
and Melia proceeded according to instructions.
Along Piccadilly itself their progress was a triumph.
For, as Melia was quick to observe, all the best people
saluted Bill. Of course they could tell by the
stripe on his sleeve that he had been made a corporal,
but such open, public and official recognition of his
merit was intensely gratifying. Brass-hatted, beribboned,
extraordinarily distinguished looking warriors
were as punctilious as could be in saluting Bill. Those
placed less highly, the rank and file, the common
herd, paid him less attention, but what were these in
the scale of an infinitely larger and nobler tribute?
By the time William and Melia turned down Saint
James's street, had an observant visitor from Mars
had the privilege of walking behind them he would
have been bound to conclude that the most important
man in the Empire was Corporal Hollis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>He would not have been alone in that feeling for
Melia was in a position to share it with him. In fact
by the time they had traversed the historic thoroughfare
and had reached Pall Mall the feeling dominated
her mind. On every hand the great ones of the earth
mustered thicker and thicker, but they kept on saluting
Bill. Such a reception was hardly to have been
expected at the center of all things, yet in those thrilling
moments so proud was Melia of her man that it
did not seem very surprising after all.</p>

<p>They crossed the road to the fine and ancient building
with the clock on it, and after making quite sure
that the King didn&rsquo;t live there&mdash;a pardonable delusion
under which for a moment they had labored&mdash;they
proceeded past it, leaving Marlborough House on
the port bow, and then suddenly, as they came into
the Mall, they caught a first glimpse of that which
they were out for to see.</p>

<p>Converging slowly upon the King&rsquo;s residence Melia&rsquo;s
courage began to fail.</p>

<p>It was a very warm day for one thing. And the sentry
in his box, not to mention his brethren marching
up and down in front of the railings, may have
daunted her. Moreover, the Palace itself was an
exceeding stately pile. Besides, she had seen the
Queen already. And Bill had passed the time of day
with her. Thus it was, gazing in silent awe through
those stern railings across that noble courtyard, Melia
suddenly made up her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Bill, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll see the King to-day&mdash;not
in this dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corporal Hollis looked solemnly at the dress in question
and then at its wearer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as <i>you</i> like, you
know, Mother,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XXV">XXV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER that they walked about for a while, but
the day was terribly hot, and all too soon the
process of seeing London on foot amid the dust of a
torrid July began to lose its charm for Melia. Besides,
had they not seen the best of London already?
Piccadilly Circus, it was true, was a washout; but
they had seen Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament,
Westminster Abbey, Trafalgar Square, and
the outside of Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s. Even in such a
place as London what else was there to compare with
these glories?</p>

<p>Such skepticism, however, was not according to the
book, and the Special Providence which had been detailed
to look after them on this entrancing day was
soon able to bring that fact to their notice. For when
they had come to the quadriga at the southwestern
extremity of the Green Park, an equestrian piece which
in the opinion of Corporal Hollis would have done no
discredit to the recognized masterpieces in Blackhampton&rsquo;s
famous gallery, and they had sincerely admired
it and the Corporal had placed his judgment on record,
lo! beyond the arch, a short stone&rsquo;s throw away,
a certain Bus, 26 by name, the exact replica of Bus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>49, that immortal machine, was miraculously awaiting
them.</p>

<p>Bus 26 was going to the Zoölogical Gardens. And
the highly efficient Special Providence who had the
arrangements in hand had contrived to book two
places on the top. That is to say its conductor informed
the Corporal with an indulgent smile that
there was just room outside for one and a little one.
Whether the conductor would have extended the same
accommodating politeness to a mere civilian belongs
to the region of conjecture, but room was undoubtedly
found for the Corporal&rsquo;s lady, and by taking upon
his knee a future Wellington&mdash;under the shadow of
whose effigy the pleasing incident occurred&mdash;in the
person of a Boy Scout in full panoply of war, the
gallant Corporal contrived to make room for himself
also.</p>

<p>At the Zoölogical Gardens they admired George,
although rather glad to find that he was only a distant
relation. They pitied the polar bears, they shuddered
at the pythons, the parrots charmed them, the larger
carnivora impressed them deeply! and then the Corporal
looked at his watch, found it was a quarter to
four and promptly ordered an ample repast for two
persons.</p>

<p>The Genie in attendance made no bones at all about
finding a small private table for them, beneath the
shade of a friendly deodar which gave a touch of
the Orient to the northwestern postal district and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>they sat for one sweet and memorable hour. Perhaps
it was the sweetest, most memorable hour that
life so far had given them. She admired this man
of hers in a way she had long ceased expecting to
admire him; she was proud of him, she was grateful
to him for the great sacrifice he was making. And
when the inner Corporal had been comforted, a crude
fellow who has to be humored even in moments of
feeling, and he had lit a Blackhampton Straight Cut,
a famous sedative known from Bond Street to Bagdad,
he took the hand of the honest woman opposite.</p>

<p>Somehow he was glad to think that she belonged
to him. The rather pale face, the careworn eyes,
the tired smile were all he had to nerve him for the
task ahead. These his only talisman in this grim hour.
Yet, a true knight, he asked no more. She was his,
a homely thing but a good and faithful one, who
had once believed in him, who had come to believe
in him again. He was able to recall the sacrifices
she had made for him, for her faith in him, for her
vision of him. As he looked across at her he felt
content to bear the gauge of this honest, doggedly
courageous woman who had helped to buckle on his
armor. He must see that he didn&rsquo;t disgrace her.</p>

<p>There was not much to say to one another. At the
best of times they were seldom articulate. But she
was able to tell him that she would be very lonely
without him. And she made him promise solemnly
to do his best to come back to her safely.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it?&rdquo; He knew she meant it, but he
allowed himself the luxury of embarrassing her.
There was a subtle pleasure in it, even if it was not
quite fair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I do, Bill. I&rsquo;ll be that lonely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor old girl! Of course she would be lonely. It
made him sigh a little when he thought how lonely
she would be. He looked at her with a rather queer
softness in his eyes. Their marriage seemed to have
brought them no luck in anything. A time there had
been, a time less than a year ago, when he had felt
very thankful that there had been no children to hasten
their steady, hopeless drift downhill. Now, however,
it was a different story. Poor Melia! Her hand
responded to the pressure of his fingers; and a large
tear crept slowly into eyes that had known them perhaps
too seldom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Mother,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I mean
to come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bill.&rdquo; The words had a curious intensity.
&ldquo;I mean you to. I&rsquo;ve set my mind on it. And if
you really set your mind on a thing happening&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He loved the spirit in her, even if he felt obliged to
touch wood as a concession to the manes of wisdom.
It didn&rsquo;t do to boast in times like these.</p>

<p>Presently they noticed that the heat was less. Bill
looked again at his watch and then they realized that
the hour of parting had drawn much nearer. Reluctantly
they got up and left the gardens, so putting an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>end to an hour of life they would never forget. Then
arm in arm they walked to Euston which was not far
off, where the Corporal retrieved his kit from the
Canteen and exchanged a valedictory smile with a
R.S.P., although he didn&rsquo;t feel like smiling. Thence
by Tube to Waterloo. It was their first experience
of this medium of travel. Even in Blackhampton,
in so many ways the home of modernity, Tubes were
unknown; they seemed exclusively, rather bewilderingly,
metropolitan.</p>

<p>The attendant Genie had to be watchful indeed to
prevent their going all round London en route from
Euston to Waterloo, but it was so alive to its duties
that they were only once baffled and then but temporarily.
Thus in the end they found themselves on
a seat on Platform Six with a full hour to wait for
the Southampton train.</p>

<p>She left him at the carriage door, a few minutes
before he was due out on his own grim journey, so
that she might have plenty of time to catch the train
for the north. Minute instructions had to be given
to enable her to do this, for London is a bewildering
maze to those not up to its ways. But the Corporal&rsquo;s
lady had a typical Blackhampton head, a thing cool,
resolute, hardy in the presence of any severe demand
upon it; and he was quite sure, and she was quite
sure, that she would be able to catch the 8:55 from
Euston, no matter what traps were laid for her.</p>

<p>It was a very simple good-by, but yet they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>torn by it in a way they had hardly expected. She
with her worn face and tired eyes was all there was
to hold him to life&mdash;she and a terrible, impersonal
sense of duty which seemed to frighten him almost.
As he watched the drab figure disappear among the
crowd on the long platform he couldn&rsquo;t help wondering....</p>

<p>But it was no use wondering. He must set his
teeth and get his head down and try to stick it no
matter what the dark fates had in store.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Corporal even at his best was not a great
hand at writing letters. And the series he
wrote from France did not flatter his powers. Really
they told hardly anything and that which they did
tell might have been far more vividly rendered. Still
in the eyes of Melia they were precious; and they did
something to soften months of loneliness and toil.</p>

<p>One other gleam there was in that sore time; a
fitful one, no doubt, and the ray it cast upon her life
so dubious, that, all things considered, it meant small
comfort. Yet, perhaps, it may have been wrong not
to accept this doubtful boon more gratefully.</p>

<p>One morning, about a fortnight after Bill&rsquo;s departure
for France, her father paid one of his periodical
visits to Love Lane. Since W. Hollis Fruiterer had
taken a turn for the better he was content with a
monthly survey instead of a weekly one in order to
assure himself that the enterprise was shipshape and
its affairs in order.</p>

<p>Melia&rsquo;s reception of her father was invariably cool.
She had a proud, unyielding nature, and Josiah&rsquo;s
tardy concession to the sternness of the times even if
it had thawed the ice a little had not really melted
it. Neither was quite at ease in the presence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>other; in both was a smoldering resentment and the
spirit of unforgiveness.</p>

<p>The books, on inspection, proved to be in very fair
order. They were carefully and neatly kept and, in
comparison with the state of affairs before a business
man came on the scene to direct them, they
showed a refreshing change for the better. The accounts
had been made up to the half year. And as
a result of eight months trading under new conditions
there was a clear profit of forty-five pounds after
a full allowance for expenses.</p>

<p>Josiah expressed himself well satisfied. In common
with the great majority of his race, material
success was the shrine at which he worshiped. Success
in this case, moreover, was doubly gratifying;
it lent point to his own foresight and judgment and
it exhibited a latent capacity in his eldest daughter.
Time alone would be able to disperse the bitterness
he cherished against her in his heart, but it did him
good to feel that she was not wholly a fool and that
in some quite important particulars she was a chip
of the old block.</p>

<p>He congratulated her solemnly in the manner of a
Chairman of Directors addressing a General Manager
and hoped she would go on as she had begun. Resentful
as she still was, she was secretly flattered by
the compliment; and she hastened to offer to repay the
sum he had advanced for the satisfaction of the former
creditors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it stand over,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;until your position&rsquo;s
a bit firmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She insisted, but he was not to be shaken; and
then, as was his way when at a loss for an argument,
he gave the contest of wills a new, unexpected turn.
&ldquo;Doing anything particular Sunday afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, she was not doing a thing particular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better come up home and have a cup of tea with
us.&rdquo; Then in a tone less impersonal: &ldquo;Your mother
would like to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blood rushed over Melia&rsquo;s face. At first she
feigned not to hear, but that did not help her. Dignity
had many demands to make, but the brusque insistence
of this father of hers seemed to cut away the
ground on which it stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say what time and I&rsquo;ll send the car for you.&ldquo;</p>

<p>The tone was so final that anything she could raise
in the way of protest seemed weakly ridiculous. But
the car for <i>her</i>! She didn&rsquo;t want the car and she
mustered force enough to say so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might as well have it. Doing nothing Sunday.
Save you a climb up the hill this hot weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of one thing, however, she was quite sure. She
didn&rsquo;t want the car. This recent and remarkable expression
of her father&rsquo;s wealth and ever-growing social
importance had taken the form of a superb motor
and a smart lady chauffeur in the neatest of green
liveries which already she had happened to see on
two occasions in Waterloo Square. No, such a ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>hicle
was not for her; and she contrived to say so with
the bluntness demanded by the circumstances, yet
tempered a little by a certain regard for anything her
father might be able to muster in the way of feelings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might as well make use of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Eating
its head off Sunday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she remained quite firm. The car was not for
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s there for you if you want it.&rdquo; His air
was majestic. &ldquo;Better pay that money into the bank.
And I shall tell your mother to expect you Sunday
tea time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was left at that. He had gained both his points.
The third was subsidiary; it didn&rsquo;t matter. All the
same it was like Josiah to raise it as a cover for those
that did.</p>

<h2 id="XXVII">XXVII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ELIA was frankly annoyed with herself for
not having put up a better resistance. The
sight of her father strutting down the street with
the honors of war upon him was a little too much for
her. He had been guilty of sixteen years of tyrannical
cruelty and she was unable to forgive. In those
sixteen years she had suffered bitterly and her stubborn
nature had great powers of resentment.</p>

<p>Who was he that he should walk down Love Lane
not merely as if he owned it&mdash;in sober truth he now
owned half&mdash;but also the souls of the people who lived
there? She could not help resenting that invincible
flare, that overweening success, particularly when she
compared it with the fecklessness of the man she had
so imprudently married. After all, she was the first-born
of this vain image and she knew his shortcomings
better than he knew them himself. He had had
more than his share of luck. No matter what the
world might think of him, however fortune might
treat him, he was not worthy of the position he had
come to occupy.</p>

<p>As soon as the ponderous broadcloth back had
turned the corner of Love Lane and was lost in that
strong-moving stream, Mulcaster Road, she made up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>her mind that she would not go up to tea on Sunday
afternoon. It was not that he really cared whether
she went or not; had he done so he would have asked
her sooner. Maybe his conscience was pricking him
a bit, but he was not one to be much troubled in that
way. In any case let it hurt him&mdash;so much the better
if it did. This was a matter in which she would
like him to be hurt as he had never been hurt before.</p>

<p>Here again, however, her father had an unfair advantage.
If she stayed away on Sunday she might
punish him a little&mdash;and even that was doubtful&mdash;but
she would certainly punish her mother far more.
And she had not the slightest wish to do that. She
was sorry for her mother, whose sins of omission
sprang from weakness of character. Nature had
placed her in a very different category. She had
fought this tyrant as hard as it was in her to fight
any one, but she was one of nature&rsquo;s underlings whose
lot was always to be trampled on.</p>

<p>Alas, if Melia didn&rsquo;t turn up on Sunday it was her
mother who would suffer. And it was a matter in
which she had suffered too much already. Melia had
no particular affection now remaining for her mother;
she even despised her for being so poor a creature,
but at least her only crime was weakness and it was
hardly fair that she should endure more than was necessary.
Melia&rsquo;s was rather a masculine nature in some
ways; at any rate her father and she had one trait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>in common. They had a sense of justice. Hence she
was now on the horns of a dilemma.</p>

<p>It was not until Sunday itself, after morning service
at Saint George&rsquo;s, that the decision was finally
made. And then fortified by Mr. Bontine, a clergyman
for whom Melia had a regard, she decided much
against her inclination to go up to The Rise in the
afternoon. It was a reluctant decision, made in soreness
of heart; the only satisfaction to be got out of
it would arise from the dubious process which the
reverend gentleman described as &ldquo;conquest of self.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She set out rather later than she meant to, in a
decidedly heavy mood. And it was not made lighter
by the fact that the afternoon was sultry with the
promise of thunder, and that the long and tedious
climb to The Rise had to be made without the help
of the tram on which she had counted. Long before
the trams from the Market Place had reached the
end of Love Lane they were full to overflowing, as
she ought to have known they would be on a fine
Sunday afternoon in the middle of the summer. In
the process of painfully mounting the stuffy length
of mean streets to achieve the space and grandeur of
The Rise she grew vexed and hot. When at last
she reached the famous eminence she was far indeed
from the frame of mind proper to the paying of a
call in its exclusive society. But it served her right.
She should have stayed at home, or at least have allowed
the motor to be sent for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>As it was, it was nearly five o&rsquo;clock when, limp
and fagged, she came at last in view of the many-windowed,
much-gabled elevation of Strathfieldsaye.
In spite of herself the sight of it made her feel nervous.
It was the home of her father and mother, but
its note of grandeur gave her a cruel sense of her
own inadequacy. At the brilliantly painted gate she
lingered a moment. Courage was called for to walk
up the broad gravel path as far as the porch with its
fine oak door studded with brass nails.</p>

<p>At last, however, she went up and rang the bell.
An extremely grand parlor maid received her almost
scornfully, and led her across a slippery but superb
entrance hall which was disconcertingly magnificent.
It was hard to grasp at that moment that such an interior
was the creation of her commonplace parents,
harder still to believe that this servant whose clothes
and manners were superior to her own was at their
beck and call.</p>

<p>However, she would go through the ordeal now she
had got so far. But this afternoon luck was heavily
against her. The ordeal proved to be more severe
than even her gloomiest moments had foreshadowed.
She was ushered just as she was, in her shabby hat
and much mended gloves, straight into the drawing-room
into the midst of company. And the company
was of the kind she would have given much to avoid.</p>

<p>She had hoped that she might find her mother alone,
or at the worst, drinking tea with her father. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>stead,
the first person she saw was the insufferable
Gertrude Preston, that mass of airs and graces which
always enabled their wearer to stand out in Melia&rsquo;s
mind as all that a woman ought not to be. And as
if the sight of Gertrude was not sufficiently chilling
and embarrassing, the second person she realized as
being present was her own stuck-up sister Ethel, invariably
known in the family as Mrs. Doctor Cockburn.
She was accompanied, however, by her two
children, little peacocks of six and seven, spoiled
fluffy masses of pink ribbons and conceit.</p>

<p>Last of all was her mother. She was always last
in any assembly. Somehow she never seemed to
count. In the old days even in her own home she could
always be talked down, or put out of countenance or
elbowed to the wall; and now, after the flight of
years, in these grand surroundings, she had not altered
in the least. She still had the eyes of a rabbit
and a fat hand that wobbled; and on Melia&rsquo;s entrance
into the room Gerty and Ethel at once took the lead
of her in the way they had always taken it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I do declare!&rdquo; Gerty rose at once with
cleverly simulated surprise tempered by a certain
stock brand of archness, kept always on tap, and unfailingly
effective in moments of sudden crisis or
emotional tension. &ldquo;How are you, Amelia?&rdquo; She
would have liked to offer her cheek, but the look in
Amelia&rsquo;s eyes forbade her risking it. Therefore, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>hand had to suffice, an elegant hand, but a wary one
which met with scant ceremony.</p>

<p>Ethel, Mrs. Doctor Cockburn, also rose, but not
immediately. &ldquo;Glad to see you, Amelia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia knew it was a lie on Ethel&rsquo;s part, and had
she had a little more self-possession might have been
moved to say so.</p>

<p>The three daughters of Mr. Josiah Munt marked
three stages in his meteoric career. Melia, the eldest,
was the child of the primitive era. Compared with
her sisters she was almost a savage. Between her
and Ethel had been a boy, Josiah, whose birth had
nearly killed Maria and who had died untimely in his
babyhood. She was not allowed in consequence to
bear any more children for ten years, and Ethel was
the natural fruit of the interregnum. Ethel was generally
allowed to be the masterpiece of the family.
Five years after her had come Sally who perhaps in
point of time and opportunity should have put out the
light even of Ethel; but in her case it seemed the
blessed word progress had moved a little too fast.
Sally, as the world knew only too well, was over-educated;
from the uplands of high intellectual development
Sally had slipped over the precipice into a mental
and moral abyss.</p>

<p>From the social and even the physical standpoint
Ethel was indubitably the pick of Mr. Josiah Munt&rsquo;s
three daughters. And Mrs. Doctor&rsquo;s rather frigid
reception of her eldest sister showed a nice perception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>of the fact. Amelia had thrown her back to a prehistoric
phase. She had something of the air and manner
of a charwoman. When she entered the room,
little shivers had crept down Ethel&rsquo;s sensitive spine.
She could hardly bear to look at her.</p>

<p>Melia also felt very uncomfortable. She couldn&rsquo;t
find a word to say and the children stared at her. But
she sat on the edge of a chair that Gerty provided; tea,
bread and butter and cake were given her; she began
to eat and drink mechanically, but still she felt
strangely hostile and unhappy. She resented the
bright plumage, the amazing prosperity of those
among whom she had been born; above all, she resented
Ethel&rsquo;s superciliousness and Gerty&rsquo;s patronage.
Ethel, of course, had a right to be supercilious, and
that fact was an added barb. Her light shone. SHE
was the only one who had shed any luster on the family;
her marriage with a doctor rising to eminence in
the town was a model of judicious ambition. Ethel
&ldquo;had done very well for herself,&rdquo; and even the set
of her hat, black tulle and white feathers and the opulent
lines of her spotted muslin dress, seemed to proclaim
it. Her bearing completed the picture. She
had not been in the same room with Amelia for many
years, although she had passed her once or twice in
the street without speaking; and at the moment her
judicious mind was fully engaged with the problem
as to whether Gwenneth and Gwladys could or could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>not call her &ldquo;Auntie.&rdquo; Finally, but not at once, the
answer was in the negative.</p>

<p>Amelia, without a word to say for herself, and
suffering acutely from a social awkwardness which
a lonely life in sordid circumstances had made much
worse, was altogether out of it. Ethel and Gerty had
charm and elegance; they spoke a different language;
they might have belonged to a different race. Amelia&rsquo;s
natural ally should have been her mother. They had
much in common but that depressed and inefficient
woman was nearly as tongue-tied as her eldest daughter.
Ethel and Gerty were almost as far beyond the
range of Maria as they were beyond the range of
Amelia; their expensive clothes and their correct talk
of This and That and These and Those, with clear,
high-pitched intonation filled her with dismay. Maria,
even in her own drawing-room, was in such awe of
them that she could make no overtures to Amelia, although
she simply longed to point to the vacant sofa
beside her and to say, &ldquo;Come and sit over here, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eldest daughter of the house bitterly regretted
the folly that had brought her among them again after
so many years of outlawry. But in a few minutes
her father came in and then she got on better. He
was the real cause of her present sufferings, but his
own freedom from self-consciousness or the least tendency
to pose amid surroundings which seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>crave that form of weakness was exactly what the situation
called for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hulloa, Melia,&rdquo; he said heartily. &ldquo;Pleased to see
you, gel.&rdquo; His lips saluted her cheek with a loud
smack. There was not a suspicion of false shame
about him. He was master in his own house at any
rate. And when he made up his mind to do a thing
he did it thoroughly. &ldquo;What do you think on &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
He pointed to his grandchildren rather proudly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Gwennie. And that&rsquo;s Gladdie. This is your
Auntie Melia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ears of Mrs. Doctor Cockburn began to burn
a little as the eyes of Gwennie and Gladdie grew
rounder and rounder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gladdie favors her ma. Don&rsquo;t you think so, eh?
And they&rsquo;ve both got a look of Grandma&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see a look of you, you know, Josiah,&rdquo; said
Auntie Gerty with an air of immense discretion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um. Maybe. Have they had any strawberries,
Grandma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their mother thought they ought not to have strawberries,
but their grandfather was convinced that a
few would not hurt them and chose half a dozen himself
from a blue dish on the tea table and presented
them personally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Gwenneth, what do you say?&rdquo; Mrs. Doctor
Cockburn&rsquo;s own mouth was full of prunes and
prisms. &ldquo;Thank you what&mdash;thank you, Grandpa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good little gel.&rdquo; There was a geniality,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>an indulgence, in the tone of Josiah that he had never
thought of extending to his own children in their nursery
days. &ldquo;And I tell you what, Ma&mdash;if they get
a pain under their pinnies they must blame their old
grand-dad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Altogether, a pleasant episode, and to everybody,
Gwenneth and Gwladys included, a welcome diversion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have some more tea, Melia.&rdquo; Her father took her
cup from her in spite of the protest her tongue was
unable to utter and handed it to the inefficient lady
in charge of the teapot. &ldquo;And you must have a few
strawberries. Fresh picked out of the garden. Ethel,
touch that bell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Doctor, with an air of resolute fineladyism,
pressed the electric button at her elbow. The grand
parlor maid entered with a smile of imperfectly concealed
cynicism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice, more cream!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia wondered how even her father was able to
address Alice in that way; but his coolness ministered
to the reluctant respect he was arousing in her by his
manly attitude to his own grandeur.</p>

<p>The cream appeared. Gwenneth and Gwladys were
forbidden to have any&mdash;their lives so far had been a
series of negations and inhibitions&mdash;but Melia had
some, although she didn&rsquo;t want it, but the will of her
father was greater than her powers of resistance. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>then he said to her, "When you&rsquo;ve had your tea, I&rsquo;ll
show you the greenus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conservatory, Josiah,&rdquo; said Aunt Gerty with an
arch preen of features and a show of plumage. &ldquo;Much
too big for a mere greenhouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greenus is more homelike, Gert. What do you
say, Mother?&rdquo; He laughed almost gayly at Maria.
The eldest daughter was amazed at the change that
seemed to be coming over her father. In the dismal
days of drudgery and gloomy terrorism at the public
house in Waterloo Square which now seemed so far
away in the past, there was not a trace of this large
and rich geniality. Prosperity, power, worldly success
must have mellowed her father as well as enlarged
him. He seemed so much bigger now, so much riper,
he seemed to care more for others.</p>

<p>Ethel and Gertrude were quite put into the shade
by the force and the heartiness of Josiah, but Mrs.
Doctor was not one lightly to play second fiddle to
any member of her own family. &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; she said,
pitching her voice upon an almost perilous note of
fashion&mdash;there was even a suspicion of a drawl which
brought an involuntary curl to Melia&rsquo;s lip&mdash;&ldquo;that
young Nixey, the architect, has been recommended
for the M.C.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he so?&rdquo; Josiah&rsquo;s eye lighted up over his
suspended teacup. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said there was something
in that young Nixey. And I&rsquo;m not often mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>taken.
He designed that row of cottages I built down
Bush Lane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A row of cottages in Bush Lane, have you, Josiah?&rdquo;
said Aunt Gerty with an air of statesmanlike
interest. &ldquo;You seem to be what they call going into
bricks and mortar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet I am&mdash;for some time now. And bricks
and mortar are not going to get less in value if this
war keeps on, take it from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doctor Cockburn, a
judge of values.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve one regret.&rdquo; It was not like Josiah to harbor
regrets of any kind, and Aunt Gerty visibly adjusted
her mind to hear something memorable.
&ldquo;That young Nixey&rsquo;s as smart as paint. I nearly
let him have the contract for this house. In some
ways he might have suited us better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this house is splendid,&rdquo; said Gerty with flagrant
optimism. She knew in her heart that the house
was too splendid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young Nixey&rsquo;s idea was something neater, more
in the Mossop style. I didn&rsquo;t see at the time, so I
got Rawlins to do it to my own design. Of course,
what I didn&rsquo;t like about Nixey was that he would
have it that he knew better than I did, and I&rsquo;m not
sure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Josiah hovered on the brink of a very
remarkable admission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree, Josiah. This house is almost perfect.&rdquo;
The specious Gertrude was amazed that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>of all men should be so near a confession that he
might have been wrong. Dark influences were at
work in him evidently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Father.&rdquo; Mrs. Doctor had
nothing of Gerty&rsquo;s finesse. &ldquo;The Gables is so refined,
a house for a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; Josiah frowned. &ldquo;Never
heard of a house being refined. Comes to that, this
place is good enough for me, any time.&rdquo; If he went
so far as to own that he might have been wrong it
was clearly the duty of others to hasten to contradict
him. &ldquo;But The Gables is more compact. More comfort
somehow, and less show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stands in less ground, must have cost less,&rdquo; said
Gerty softly. &ldquo;Compared to Strathfieldsaye, The Gables
to my mind is rather niggardly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is so, Gert.&rdquo; He nodded approvingly. She
was always there with the right word. &ldquo;All the same
I believe in that young Nixey. Started, you know,
at the Council School. Won a scholarship at the
University. Why, I remember his mother when she
used to come to the Duke of Wellington and sew for
Maria. Done everything for himself. And now he&rsquo;s
a commissioned officer in the B.B. Give honor where
honor&rsquo;s due, I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerty and Ethel agreed, perhaps a little reluctantly.
Maria expressed a tacit approval. And then Melia
made the discovery that her mind had wandered as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>far as France; and for a moment or so the world&rsquo;s
pressure upon her felt a little less stifling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, how that young man&rsquo;s got on!&rdquo; There
was reverence in the tone of Gerty whose religion
was &ldquo;getting on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Josiah was emphatic. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hold
some people back. I give him another ten years to
be the first architect in this town ... if he comes
through This.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big &lsquo;if.&rsquo;&rdquo; Before the words were out of
Gerty&rsquo;s mouth she remembered Amelia&rsquo;s husband and
wished them unsaid. She had not had the courage to
mention William Hollis with poor Amelia so rigidly
on the defensive, but she had hoped that some one
would introduce the subject so that a tribute might be
paid him. But no one had done so, and now that
Josiah was there the time seemed to have gone by.
His views in regard to Amelia&rsquo;s husband were far
too definite to be challenged lightly.</p>

<p>Interest in young Nixey, the architect, began to
wane and then suddenly Ethel startled them all by
the statement that she had just had a letter from
Sally.</p>

<p>Josiah&rsquo;s geniality promptly received a coating of
ice. His mouth closed like a trap. Sally had not
been forgiven by her father and those who knew him
best had the least hope that she would be. Her conduct
had struck him in a very tender place, and Gerty
could not help thinking that it was most imprudent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>of Ethel to mention Sally in his presence in any circumstances.</p>

<p>Ethel, however, had long ceased to fear her father.
For one thing, in the eyes of the world her position
was too secure. Besides, she was obtuse. Where angels,
etc., Mrs. Doctor could always be trusted to
walk with a certain measure of assurance, mainly because
she didn&rsquo;t see things and feel things in the way
that most people did. For that reason she was not
at all disconcerted by the silence that followed her
announcement. And she supplemented it with another
which compelled Gerty, the adroit, to steal a veiled
glance at the sphinx-like face of her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She writes from Serbia, giving a long and wonderful
account of her doings with the Red Cross. I
think I have her letter with me.&rdquo; Ethel opened a
green morocco bag that was on the sofa beside her.
&ldquo;Yes ... here it is ... a long account. Care to
read it, Father?&rdquo; She offered the letter unconcernedly
to Josiah.</p>

<p>He shook his head somberly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not read it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me leave it with you. Well worth reading.
But I&rsquo;d like to have it back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, take it with you, gel.&rdquo; The words were
sharp. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t much time for reading anything these
days. Happen I&rsquo;ll lose it or something.&rdquo; It was
lame and obvious, but Josiah had been taken too much
by surprise to do anything better. Gerty was annoyed
with Ethel. She had no right to be so tact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>less.
None knew so well as Ethel the state of the
case in regard to Sally. At the same time Gerty&rsquo;s
respect for Josiah which amounted to genuine regard
was a little wounded. He ought to have been big
enough to have read the letter.</p>

<p>Ethel had contrived to banish the ease and the sunshine
from the proceedings. The light of genial humor
in the eyes of her father yielded to the truculence
of that earlier epoch so familiar to Amelia. It
was a great pity that it should be so; and after a
tense moment the gallant Gerty did her best to pour
oil on the vexed waters. &ldquo;The other day in the
<i>Tribune</i> they were praising you finely, Josiah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was they?&rdquo; The King&rsquo;s English was not his
strong point in moments of tension. But in any moment,
as Gerty knew, he had his share of the legitimate
vanity of the rising publicist. &ldquo;What did they
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Tribune</i> said you deserved well, not only of
your fellow townsmen, but of the country at large
for the excellent work you had done in the last nine
months for the national cause. They said your work
on the Recruiting and Munitions Committees had
been most valuable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah was visibly mollified by this piping. &ldquo;Very
decent of the <i>Tribune</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make an excellent mayor, Josiah. Your
turn next year, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah nodded. The light came again into his eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no saying what sort of a mayor I&rsquo;ll make.
It&rsquo;s a stiff job when you come to tackle it. Big responsibility
in times like these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not the man to shirk responsibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah allowed that he was not, but the office of
mayor in a place like Blackhampton in times like
these was no sinecure for a man with a sense of civic
duty. Once more he clouded. From what he heard
things were looking pretty bad. If England was going
to win the war she should have to find a better
set of brains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely the Allies are quite as clever as the
Germans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may be, but they haven&rsquo;t shown it so far.
We are a scratch lot of amateurs against a team of
trained professionals. The raw material is just as
good, if not better, but it takes time to lick it in to
shape. And we&rsquo;ve got to learn to use it.&rdquo; His gloom
deepened. &ldquo;Still we shall never give in to the Hun
... not in a hundred years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ethel concurred in this robust sentiment. And then
again she obtusely referred to Sally&rsquo;s letter. It was
such a wonderful letter that her father really ought
to read it. He was clearly annoyed by her tactless
persistence. In order to cloak his feelings he called
upon Melia in the old peremptory way to come and
look at his tomatoes.</p>

<p>As they rose for that purpose, Mrs. Doctor Cockburn
rose also. She must really be going; it was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>cook&rsquo;s evening out. Gwenneth and Gwladys were
bidden to say good-by to Grandpa. They did so shyly
but rather prettily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let me see you shake hands with your Auntie
Melia,&rdquo; said Josiah.</p>

<p>Gwenneth and Gwladys accomplished this task less
successfully. They were half terrified by this shabby,
gloomy, silent woman who had not a word to say.</p>

<h2 id="XXVIII">XXVIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>EEKS went by and Melia settled down to a
hard and lonely winter in Love Lane. She
missed Bill sadly now he was no longer there. Absence
had conferred all sorts of virtues upon him.
She quite forgot that for many years and up till very
recently she could hardly bear the sight of him about
the place. Their relations as man and wife had entered
upon a new and very remarkable phase.</p>

<p>About once a fortnight or so life was made a bit
lighter for her by a penciled scrawl from somewhere
in France. Bill&rsquo;s letters told surprisingly little, yet
he maintained a kind of grim cheeriness and seemed
more concerned for the life she might be leading than
for anything that was happening to himself. He was
very grateful for the small comforts she sent him
from time to time, he was much interested in the continued
prosperity of the business, and he mentioned
with evident pleasure that her mother had sent him
a pair of socks and a comforter she had knitted herself,
also a &ldquo;nice letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From his mother-in-law, whom Bill had always suspected
of being a good sort at heart, &ldquo;if the Old Un
would give her a chance,&rdquo; he had an account of Melia&rsquo;s
visit to Strathfieldsaye. Her mother said what plea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>sure
it would give her father if she would go there
every Sunday. The statement was incredible on the
face of it; Bill frankly didn&rsquo;t know what to think,
but there it was. No doubt the old girl meant kindly.
Perhaps it was her idea of bucking him up.</p>

<p>In his letters to Melia he made no comment on the
life he was leading, but in one he told her that they
had moved up into the Line; in another that &ldquo;the
Boche had got it in the neck&rdquo;; in another that &ldquo;he
had got the rheumatics so that he could hardly move,&rdquo;
but that he meant to carry on as long as possible,
adding, &ldquo;We are very short of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow the letters of that dark winter made her
more proud than ever of this man of hers. There
was a determined note of quiet cheerfulness that she
had never known in him before. Instead of the eternal
grumbling that had done so much to embitter her,
there was a tone of whimsical humor which at a time
made her laugh, although as a general rule few people
found it harder than she did to laugh at anything.
She had little imagination, still less of the penetration
of mind that goes with it, but there was one
phrase he used that was hard to forget. In one letter
he was tempted to complain that the Boche had
taken to raiding them in the middle of the night, but
he added a postscript, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use growsing here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow that phrase stuck in her mind. When
she rose before daylight in the bitter mornings of
midwinter to light the kitchen fire and prepare a meal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>she would have to eat alone, she would remember
those words which he of all men had used, he who was
a born growser if ever there was one. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use
growsing here.&rdquo; She tried to take in their meaning,
but the task was not easy. He wrote so cheerfully
that he could hardly mean what he said. And it was
his nearest approach to complaint, he whose life in
peace time had been one long complaint. Now and
again she read in the <i>Tribune</i> of things that made
her shiver. Sometimes in the winter darkness she
awoke with these things in her mind. Bill&rsquo;s letters,
however, gave no details. If he spoke of &ldquo;a scrap,&rdquo;
he did so casually, without embroidery, yet she remembered
that once when he had cut his thumb, not
very badly, he fainted at the sight of blood.</p>

<p>Such letters were a puzzle; they told so little. She
couldn&rsquo;t make them out. Reading between the lines,
he seemed to be enjoying life more than he had ever
done, he seemed to realize the humor of it more. It
was very strange that it should be so, especially on the
part of one who had always taken things so hard.
In one letter he said that spring was coming and that
the look of the sky made him think of the crocuses
along Sharrow Lane, and then added as a brief postscript,
&ldquo;Stanning&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some weeks later he wrote from the Base to say
that &ldquo;he had had a whiff of gas, nothing to speak of,&rdquo;
but that he was out of the Line for a bit. And then
after a cheerful letter or two in the meantime, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>wrote a month later to say that he had got leave for
ten days and that he was coming home.</p>

<p>It was the middle of June when he turned up in
Love Lane late one evening, without notice, laden
like a beast of burden, looking very brown and well
but terribly worn and shabby. So much had he
changed in appearance that Melia felt it would have
been easy to pass him in the street without recognizing
him. He was thin and gray, even his features,
and particularly his eyes, seemed to have altered. The
tone of his voice was different; he spoke in a different
way; the words and phrases he used were not
those of the William Hollis she had always known.</p>

<p>He was glad to be back in his home, if only for a
few days, and the sight of him with his heavy pack
and his gas mask and his helmet laid on the new linoleum
in the little sitting room behind the shop gave
her a deeper pleasure than anything life had offered
her so far. Strange as he was, new almost to the
point of being somebody else, the mere sight of him
thrilled her. She was thrilled to the verge of happiness.
It was something beyond any previous emotion.
Long ago she had given up believing that ever
again he would appeal to her in the way of that brief
time which had been once and had passed so soon.</p>

<p>He took off his heavy boots and lit his pipe and
seemed childishly glad to be home again. But he
didn&rsquo;t talk much. He sighed luxuriously and smiled
at her in his odd new way, yet he was interested in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>the excellent supper she gave him presently and in
the account she furnished of the business which was
still on an ascending curve of prosperity. The old
wound, still unhealed, would not allow her to praise
her father, but there was more than one instance to
offer of that tardy repentance; and it was hard to
repress a note of pride when she announced that he
was now Mayor of Blackhampton and by all accounts
a good one.</p>

<p>She tried to get her husband to speak of France,
but some instinct soon made it clear to her that he
wanted to forget it. He could not be induced to speak
of his experiences, made light of his &ldquo;whiff of gas,&rdquo;
but confessed it was hell all the time; he also said
that the German was not a clean fighter. As he sat
opposite to her, eating his supper, his reticence made
it impossible for her to realize what he had been
through. He did not seem to realize it himself, except
that in a subtle way he was altogether changed.</p>

<p>He was eight days at home and they spent a lot
of the time together. They had a new kind of intimacy;
the world of men and affairs had altered for
them both. Everything came to them at a fresh angle.
They were dwellers in another atmosphere. The
most commonplace actions meant much more; events
once of comparatively large importance meant much
less. She half suggested that they should go up on
Sunday afternoon to Strathfieldsaye, but the idea
evidently did not appeal to him and she did not press
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>it. Still she threw out the hint, because it was an
opportunity to let bygones be bygones and she was sure
that he would meet with a good reception. A sense
of justice impelled her to be grateful to her father,
much as she disliked him; in his domineering way he
had tried to make amends; all the same she was not
sorry that Bill was determined to hold himself aloof.
It was not exactly that he bore a grudge against her
father; at the point he had reached men did not bear
grudges, but he had some decided views on the matter
and they gained in power by not being expressed.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of Wednesday, which was early
closing day in Blackhampton, Bill insisted on taking
Melia to the Art Gallery. It was in the historic low-roofed
building in New Square&mdash;which dated from
the Romans&mdash;known as the old Moot Hall. It was
now the home of one of the finest collections of pictures
in the country. Among ancient masterpieces
and some modern ones were several characteristic examples
of his friend, Stanning, R.A., whom he had
carried dying into a dugout not four months ago.</p>

<p>Corporal Hollis had it from Sergeant Stanning&rsquo;s
own lips that the best picture he had ever painted was
hung in the middle room, and that it was not the
Sharrow at Corfield Weir, which the Corporal himself
admired so much, but the smaller, less ambitious
piece called, &ldquo;The Leaves of the Tree&rdquo;&mdash;a picture of
the woods up at Dibley in the sunlight of October,
stripped by the winds of autumn, with the bent figure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>in the foreground of a very old man raking the dead
leaves together.</p>

<p>They had no difficulty in finding it. &ldquo;As the leaves
of the trees are the lives of men.&rdquo; That legend on
the gilt frame seemed to them both at that moment
strangely, terribly prophetic. Bill did not tell Melia
as they stood in front of the picture that he had risked
his own life in a vain attempt to save the man who
had painted it, nor did he tell her that the blood of
the artist had dyed the sleeves of his tunic.</p>

<p>The large room was empty and they sat down solemnly
on the settee in front of this canvas, looking
at it in silence, yet as they did so holding the hand
of each other like a pair of children. Once before
had they sat there, in the early days of their marriage,
when he had talked to her of those ambitions
that were never to materialize. And now, again, with
the spirit of peace upon him and stirred by old memories,
he sighed to himself and spoke for a moment
or two of what might have been. One of these days
he had hoped to do something. He had always intended
to do something but the time had slipped away.</p>

<p>They were still sitting there looking at the picture
when two people came into the room. One was a
commonplace elderly woman, the other a young man
in khaki. Although they were totally unlike in the
superficialities of outward bearing it was easy to tell
that they were mother and son. His trained movements
and upright carriage, his poise and alertness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>were not able to conceal an odd resemblance to the
wholly different person at his side.</p>

<p>William and Melia were concealed by the high-backed,
wide-armed settee on which they sat; and
as these two people came up the room and took up
a position behind it, they did not seem to realize that
they could be overheard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you, mother,&rdquo; said the young man in an
eager voice, &ldquo;to look at what to my mind is the picture
of this collection. Stand here and you&rsquo;ll get it
just right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal and his lady on the high-backed settee
offered a silent prayer that the young man had as much
wisdom and taste as the owner of such a clear, confident
voice ought to have. &ldquo;As the leaves of the
tree are the lives of men.&rdquo; The Corporal breathed
more freely; the young man&rsquo;s voice had not belied
him. &ldquo;Homer&rsquo;s words.&rdquo; He reeled off pat a large-sounding
foreign language. &ldquo;I want you to catch
the ghost of the sun glancing through these wind-torn
branches. You&rsquo;ll get the light if you stand just
here. Wonderful composition ... wonderful vision
... wonderful harmony ... wonderful everything.
The big artists feel with their eyes.&rdquo; It was
charming to hear the voice in its enthusiasm. &ldquo;They
look behind the curtain of appearances as you might
say. The life of man is but the shadow of a shadow
... you remember that bit of Lucretius I read you
last night? Look at the figure in the foreground gath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>ering
the leaves. Modern critics say symbolism is not
art, but it depends on how it&rsquo;s done, doesn&rsquo;t it? The
eyes of the mind ... imagination ... and that&rsquo;s
the only key we have to the Riddle of the Sphinx.&rdquo;
He ran on and on, laughing like a child. &ldquo;Look at
his color. And how spacious!&mdash;imagination there!&mdash;the
harmony, the drawing! A marvelous draughtsman.
If he&rsquo;d lived he&rsquo;d have been a second Torrington,
although you hear people say that Torrington
couldn&rsquo;t draw.&rdquo; He laughed like a schoolboy and
then his voice fell. &ldquo;I like to think that Jim Stanning
was one of us, that he was born among us, and
it&rsquo;s good to think that our old one-horse Art Committee
has had the luck to buy his magnum opus without
knowing it. They paid twice as much for Corfield
Weir in the other room, which is not in the same
class. However ... posterity....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prattling on and on the young man came round the
corner of the settee, followed by the old lady.</p>

<p>And then his flow of words failed suddenly as he
caught a glimpse of William and Melia, whose presence
he had been far from suspecting. His little start
of guilt betrayed a feeling that he had made rather
an ass of himself, for he said half shamefacedly,
&ldquo;Come on, my dear, let&rsquo;s go and look at the Weir.
We&rsquo;ll come back here later.&rdquo; The Corporal and his
lady could only catch a glimpse of him as he led his
mother abruptly into the next room; but Melia saw
he was an officer with two pips on his sleeve and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>his tunic was adorned with a tiny strip of white and
purple ribbon with a star on it. In answer to her
questions the Corporal was able to inform her that
the young man was a Captain in the B.B. and that
his decorations was the M.C. with Bar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he looks so young!&rdquo; said Melia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very good soldier,&rdquo; said the Corporal with a
professional air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he, Bill? I seem to remember his mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s young Nixey, the architect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course! But his uniform had altered him. He
looked so handsome. And that was Emma Nixey&mdash;Emma
Price that was. How proud she must be to
have a boy like that!</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good soldier.&rdquo; The deep voice of the Corporal
broke in upon Melia&rsquo;s thoughts. &ldquo;A good soldier&mdash;that
young feller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bill, you remember Emma Price that used to live
at the bottom of Piper&rsquo;s Hill?&rdquo; There was a note
of envy in the tone of Melia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember old Price, the cobbler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma was his eldest girl&mdash;no, not the eldest.
Polly who married Ford, the ironmonger, was the
eldest. Emma was the second. Married Harry Nixey,
whose mother kept the all-sorts shop in Curwood
Street. A drunken fellow, but very clever at his
trade. Bolted with another woman when this lad
Harold was twelve months old. Emma never saw nor
heard of him again. Went to Australia, people said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>at the time. But I&rsquo;ll say this for Emma, she was
always a good plucked one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence and then the Corporal
demanded weightily, &ldquo;Has she any others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the only one. But brought up very respectable
... she&rsquo;s managed to give him a rare good education.
How she did it nobody knows. Tremendous
worker, was Emma. But that boy does her credit, I
must say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does that.&rdquo; The Corporal stared hard at the
picture in front of him. &ldquo;Nothing like education.&rdquo;
He sighed softly. &ldquo;If only I&rsquo;d had a bit of education
I sometimes think I might have done something myself.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="XXIX">XXIX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">O</span>N the afternoon of the day before the Corporal
returned to France he went with Melia by bus
to Sharrow Bridge and they walked thence to Corfield
Weir. Many hours had he spent with rod and
tackle in this hallowed spot. Those were the only
hours in his drab life that he would have desired to
live over again. Many a good fish had he played in
the bend of the river below the famous Corfield Glade,
much commemorated by the local poets in whom the
town and county were exceptionally rich. In particular
there was the legend of the fair Mary Corfield
who in the days of Queen Bess had cast herself
for love of an honest yeoman into the deep waters
of the Sharrow. From Bill&rsquo;s favorite tree, where
from boyhood he had spun so many dreams that had
come to naught, could be seen the high chimneys of
the Old Hall, the home of the ill-fated Mary, about
whose precincts her ghost still walked and was occasionally
seen.</p>

<p>The day was perfect, a rare golden opulence of sky
and earth with a sheen of beauty on wood and field
and flowing water. They came to the little gnarled
clump of alders, his old-time friends, whom the swift-flowing
Sharrow was always threatening to devour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>and lay side by side in the shade, on the dry grass,
listening to the great rats plopping into the cool water.</p>

<p>Both were very silent at first; it was as if nature
spoke to them in a new way. It was as if their eyes
were bathed in a magical light. All the things around
them were clearer in outline, brighter, sharper, more
visible. Their ears, too, were attuned to a higher intensity.
The swirl of the water, the rustle of leaves,
the cry of the birds, the little voice of the wind, were
more intimate, more harmonious, more audibly full
of meaning. The world itself had never seemed so
richly amazing, so gorgeously inexhaustible as at that
moment.</p>

<p>At last the Corporal broke a very long silence.
&ldquo;Mother, it&rsquo;s something to have lived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia did not answer at once, but presently she
sighed a little and said, &ldquo;I wonder, Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He plucked a spear of grass. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rum thing
to say, but if it hadn&rsquo;t been for this war I don&rsquo;t suppose
I ever should have lived, really.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t understand him, and her large round
eyes, a little like those of a cow, told him so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been thinking too much about it, you
see.&rdquo; His voice was curiously gentle. &ldquo;All my life,
as you might say, I&rsquo;ve always been telling myself what
a wonderful day it was going to be to-morrow. But
to-morrow never comes, you see. And you keep on
thinking, thinking, until you suddenly find that to-morrow
was yesterday. That&rsquo;s how it was with me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>And if I hadn&rsquo;t had the guts to join up just when I
did, my belief is I should never have lived at all.
Understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook a placid head at him, not understanding
him in the least. But this was the mood in which
he had first captured her, in which he had first impressed
her with his intellectual quality, for which, as
a raw girl, who knew nothing about anything, she
had had a sort of reverence. But as she had come to
see, it was this very power of mind, which she had told
herself was not shared by other, more common men,
that had been his undoing, that had brought them
both to the verge of ruin. It was fine and all that,
but it didn&rsquo;t mean anything. It was just a kink in
the machine which prevented it from working properly.</p>

<p>The tears sprang to her eyes as she listened to him,
and her youth and his came back to her, but she turned
her face to the river so that he could not see it. Still
it was not all pain to hear him talking. It was the
old, old way that she had loved once and had since
despised, but now lying there in the shade of those
old trees, with the music of the Weir and the glory of
the earth and the sky all about her, she loved again.
Strange that it should be so! But the sad voice at
her elbow blended marvelously with all the things
she could see and hear. And what it said was quite
true. By some miracle both were living now more
fully than ever before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always have one regret, Mother.&rdquo; His voice
had grown as deep as the water itself. But it broke
off in the middle suddenly.</p>

<p>A feeling came upon her that she ought to say
something. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us have no regrets, Bill.&rdquo;
Those were the words she wanted to utter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
have none.&rdquo; But they were not for her to speak. At
that moment she was not able to say anything. She
waited tensely for him to go on talking.</p>

<p>In the odd way he had, which was a part of his
peculiar faculty, he seemed to feel what was passing
in her mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of what might have
been. That&rsquo;s no good. The time&rsquo;s gone by. I&rsquo;m
thinking of my friend, Stanning, R.A. You see we&rsquo;d
arranged that if we ever had the chance we&rsquo;d come
here for a day&rsquo;s fishing. We had a bit one day when
we were up in the Line&mdash;in that canal&mdash;the Yser, I
think they call it. And he said, &lsquo;Auntie, I may be
able to tell you a thing or two about drawing, but
when it comes to this game the boot&rsquo;s on the other
leg.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve put my heart
into it while you&rsquo;ve put your heart into something
better.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rsquo; he said&mdash;he
was the broadest-minded, the best read, the wisest
chap I ever talked to&mdash;&lsquo;nothing is but thinking makes
it so, as Hamlet, that old crackpot used to say. Whatever
you happen to be doing, Auntie, the only thing
that matters is whether your heart is in it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;I daresay you are right there. But it&rsquo;s one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>thing to catch barbel. It&rsquo;s another to paint Corfield
Weir.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Melia this seemed like philosophy. And she
had no head for philosophy, although inclined to be
a little proud that Bill should be able to swim in these
deep waters in such distinguished company. But one
thing aroused her curiosity. Why was this man of
hers called Auntie?</p>

<p>Bill laughed good humoredly when, a little scandalized,
she came to put the question. &ldquo;They all call
me that in C company.&rdquo; His frankness was remarkable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say I was born an old woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia thought it was like their impertinence and
did not hesitate to say so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t know the Chaps,&rdquo; Bill laughed
heartily. &ldquo;The Chaps is a rum crowd. They call you
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to your face?&rdquo; Melia couldn&rsquo;t help resenting
it and spoke with dignity. &ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to let
them, Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Corporal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Stanning was a sergeant, you see. And nobody
means nothing by it. It&rsquo;s a way they have in
the army of being friendly and pleasant. And I
daresay it suits me. My fingers is all thumbs as you
might say. Fishing and a bit o&rsquo; gardening are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>only things I&rsquo;m good for, although Stanning told me
that in time, if I stuck it, I might be able to draw.
And that was a lot for him to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia thought that it must be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I often wonder,&rdquo;&mdash;the eyes of the Corporal were
fixed on the Sharrow&mdash;&ldquo;what made Stanning take up
with a chap like me. There was lots of &rsquo;em in C company
with far more education, but he told me once
that I was the same kind of fool that he was and I
said that I wished it was so. I suppose he meant that
I liked to talk about this old river and the lights on
it and the look of it at different times of the year.
He knew every yard of the Sharrow between here
and Dibley and so did I, but he could see things that
I couldn&rsquo;t, and he could remember &rsquo;em and he&rsquo;d a wonderful
eye for nature. He wasn&rsquo;t the least bit of a
soldier, no more than myself, but he made a first-rate
job of it&mdash;he was the kind of chap who would make
a first-rate job of anything. Our C.O. wanted him
to apply for a commission, but he said he couldn&rsquo;t face
the responsibility. That was queer, wasn&rsquo;t it, in a man
of that sort?&mdash;for he was a man, I give you my
word.&rdquo; The Corporal plucked another spear of grass
and began to chew it pensively. &ldquo;He had a cottage
up at Dibley, that largish white one on the left, standing
back from the road, you know the one I mean&mdash;the
one with the iron gate, and that funny sort of a
tower at the end of the garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia said she did know, although she had half fo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>rgotten
it, but she hadn&rsquo;t been to Dibley since they were
first married, and that was a long time ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It belonged to Torrington the artist. He lived
and died there. Stanning said he was the greatest
painter of landscape that ever lived, but nobody knew
it while he was alive and he died in poverty. Not that
it mattered. Stanning said that money doesn&rsquo;t matter
to an artist, but he said that many an artist had been
ruined by making it too easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This dictum of Stanning&rsquo;s sounded odd in the ear
of Melia. No one could be ruined by making money
too easily, but she had not the heart to contradict his
disciple who was still chewing grass and looking up
at the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what I mean, Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makes them take to drink and gambling, I suppose.&rdquo;
After all, there was that solution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stanning meant that if an artist gets money too
easy it&rsquo;ll take the edge off his work. He was always
afraid that was what was going to happen to himself.
In 1913 he made six thousand pounds&mdash;think on it,
Mother, six thousand pounds in one year painting pictures!
He said that was the writing on the wall for
him; he said it was as much as Torrington made in
all his life and he lived beyond eighty. &lsquo;And I&rsquo;m not
fit to tie Torrington&rsquo;s shoelace, Auntie.&rsquo; I laughed
at that, of course, but he was not a man to want butter.
&lsquo;I mean it, my dear.&rsquo; If he liked you he had
a way of calling you &lsquo;my dear,&rsquo; like one girl does to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>another. &lsquo;Torrington was the only man that ever
lived who could handle sunlight. That&rsquo;s the test for a
painter. If I touch sunlight I burn holes in the canvas.&rsquo;
Of course, I laughed, but Stanning was a very
humble chap when he talked about his own paintings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the Corporal realized that he had let his
tongue run away with him, as it did sometimes. Melia
was getting drowsy. He got up, therefore, and
stretched his legs on the soft turf and then he said,
&ldquo;Let us go across to the Corfield Arms and see if we
can get a cup of tea. And then if you feel up to it
we&rsquo;ll walk through the Glade as far as Dibley and
look at the house that Torrington lived in.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XXX">XXX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HEY went across to the Corfield Arms. It was
an old, romantic looking inn, spoiled a little in
these later days by contiguity to a great hive of commerce.
But there were occasions, even now, when it
retained something of the halo of ancient peace it
was wont to bear; and the afternoon being Friday
was an off day for visitors. When Bill and Melia
passed through the bowling green at the back of the
house to the arbor where last they had sat in the days
of their courtship they found it empty.</p>

<p>In the garden by the arbor an old man was plucking
raspberries. He turned out to be the landlord, and to
the secret gratification of Melia he addressed Bill as
&ldquo;sir,&rdquo; out of deference to his uniform. Upon receiving
the Corporal&rsquo;s commands he called loudly for
&ldquo;Polly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In two shakes of a duck&rsquo;s tail Polly appeared: a
blithe beauty in a clean lilac print dress, a little shrunk
in the wash, which showed to advantage the lovely
lines of her shape and the slender stem of a brown
but classic neck in which a nest of red-gold hair hung
loose. The Corporal ordered a royal repast for two
persons; a pot of tea, boiled eggs, bread and butter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>cake, and a little of the honey for which the house
used to be famous.</p>

<p>While they waited for the tea, the Corporal gave
the old chap a hand with the raspberries. &ldquo;Happen
you remember Torrington, the artist who lived up
at Dibley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; The old man remembered him without difficulty.
&ldquo;Knew him well when I was young. Soft
Jack we used to call him; an old man and just a bit
touched like as I remember him. Long beard he had
and blue eyes&mdash;wonderful blue eyes had that old feller.
Out painting in the open all day long, in all
weathers. I used to stand for hours and watch him.
He&rsquo;d paint a bit, and then he&rsquo;d paint it out, and then
he&rsquo;d paint it in again. &rsquo;Course he was clever, you
know, in a manner of speaking. Nobody thought much
of him then, but in these days, if you&rsquo;ll believe me,
I&rsquo;ve known people come specially from London to ask
about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal turned to Melia with an air of discreet
triumph. But Melia was so drowsy that she said she
would go into the arbor until the tea came. She
was encouraged to do so while the landlord went on,
&ldquo;I was a bit of a favorite with old Soft Jack. Many&rsquo;s
the boy I&rsquo;ve lammoxed for throwing stones at his
easel. Of course, at the time I speak of, the old chap
had got a bit tottery; he lived to be tight on ninety.
But as I say nobody thought much of him, yet if you&rsquo;ll
believe me it&rsquo;s only last year, or the year before last&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>I&rsquo;m
getting on myself&mdash;that a college gentleman came
down here to write a book about him. A very nice
civil-spoken gentleman; but fancy writing a book
about old Soft Jack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever buy any of his pictures?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father did. Gave as much as five pounds for
one, more out of charity than anything, I&rsquo;ve heard
him say, but if you&rsquo;ll believe me when the old boy was
dead my father sold that picture for twenty pounds,
and they tell me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve not seen it myself&mdash;that that
picture is now in our Art Gallery, and the college gentleman
I&rsquo;m speaking of&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;says folk
come from all parts of the world to look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happen there was the sun in it,&rdquo; said the Corporal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very like. Most of his pictures had the sun in
&rsquo;em, what I remember. You know they do say that
that old chap could look at the sun with the naked eye.
And such an eye as it was&mdash;like an eagle&rsquo;s, even when
he was old and past it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got any of his pictures now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I have. My father had one or two odd
bits, but he sold &rsquo;em or gave &rsquo;em away. No good
having a picture, I&rsquo;ve heard the dad say, unless you&rsquo;ve
a frame to put it in. And frames was dear in those
days. If you&rsquo;ll believe me, the frame often cost more
than the picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pity you haven&rsquo;t one or two by you now. They
do say all Torrington&rsquo;s pictures are worth a sight o&rsquo;
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Money&rsquo;s more plentiful now
than it used to be. My father was &rsquo;mazed when he
got twenty pounds for the one he sold, and he heard
afterwards it fetched as high as fifty. But I&rsquo;m speaking,
of course, of when the old man was dead. That
reminds me, the old chap, being very hard up, painted
our signboard. It wants a fresh coat now, but it&rsquo;s
wonderful how it&rsquo;s lasted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal, in his devotion to art, ceased to pick
raspberries, and accompanied by his host, went to
look at the expression of Soft Jack&rsquo;s genius upon the
ancient front of the Corfield Arms. As they crossed
the bowling green they came upon the smiling and
gracious Polly, who bore a tea tray heavily laden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady&rsquo;s in the summerhouse.&rdquo; The gallant Corporal
returned smile for smile. &ldquo;Tell her to pour
out the tea and I&rsquo;ll be along in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The signboard, after all, was not much to look at.
The arms of the Corfields consisted in the main of a
rampant unicorn, reft by the weather of a good deal
of paint. But even here, by some miracle, the sunlight
was shining on the noble horns of the fabulous
animal, but whether the phenomenon was due to purely
natural causes on this glorious afternoon of July,
or whether the great artist was personally responsible
for it was more than Corporal Hollis was able to
say. It needed the trained eye of a Stanning, R.A.,
or of a young Nixey, the architect, to determine the
point, but in the right-hand corner of the signboard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>beyond a doubt, as the landlord was able to indicate
with an air of pride, was Soft Jack&rsquo;s monogram, J. T.</p>

<p>Somehow the monogram saved the signboard itself
from being a washout as a work of art, and the Corporal
felt grateful for it as he returned to the arbor
to drink tea with his wife, while the landlord, less
of a critic, went back to the raspberries in his prolific
garden.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XXXI">XXXI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER an excellent tea William and Melia went
up the road to Dibley. It was two miles on and
they took a path of classic beauty, fringed by a grove
of elms in which the rooks were cawing, along a
carpet of green bracken through which the lovely
river wound. Dibley stood high, at the crest of a
great clump of woodland, with the Sharrow silver-breasted
below surging through a glorious valley.</p>

<p>It was getting on for twenty years since Bill had
last handed Melia over the stile at the top of the
glade, famous in song and story, and they had debouched
arm in arm past the vicarage, along the bridle
path, and had threaded their way through a nest of
thatched cottages to the village green. The sun had
now waned a little and the air had cooled on these
shaded heights, the tea had been refreshing, and, for
a few golden moments, inexpressibly sweet yet tragically
fleeting, the courage of youth came back to them.
Just beyond the parson&rsquo;s gate the Corporal stopped
suddenly, took Melia in his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>It was a sloppy thing to do, unworthy of old married
people, but the guilt of the act was upon them,
though neither knew exactly why it should have come
about. They crossed the paddock and went on through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>the romantic village, so sweetly familiar in its changelessness.
It seemed but yesterday since they walked
through it last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wondered sometimes,&rdquo; whispered the Corporal
at the edge of the green, &ldquo;what made you marry
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believed in you, Bill; I always believed in you.&rdquo;
It was a great answer, yet somehow it was unexpected.
In his heart he knew he was not worthy of it and
that seemed to make it greater still.</p>

<p>Facing the duck pond, at the far end of the green,
was the white cottage in which Torrington the artist
had lived and died. It had changed a bit since his
time. Things had been added by his more opulent
successor. There were an iron gate, a considerable
garden and a tall tower with a glass roof which nobly
commanded the steep wooded slopes of the valley of
the Sharrow.</p>

<p>With the new eyes a great painter had given him
Bill saw at once that this was a rare pitch for an artist.
It was one of the most beautiful spots in the
land. The immense city of Blackhampton with its
thousands of chimneys and its roaring factories might
have been a hundred miles off instead of a bare four
miles down the valley. There was not a glimpse or a
sound of it here in this peace-haunted woodland, in
this enchantment of stream and hill, bathed in a pomp
of golden cloud and magic beauty.</p>

<p>The simple cottage had been modernized and am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>plified,
but with rare tact and cunning, so that it was
still &ldquo;all of a piece,&rdquo; much as Torrington had left.
But the house itself was empty, with green shutters
across the windows. On the gate was a padlock, the
reason for which was given in a printed bill stuck on
a board that had been raised beside it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>By order of the executors of the late James Stanning,
Esqre., A.R.A., to be sold by auction the valuable and historical
property known as Torrington Cottage Dibley, together
with the following furniture and effects.</p></div>

<p>A list followed of the furniture and effects, but
across the face of the bill was pasted a diagonal red-lettered
slip,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This property has been sold by private treaty.</p></div>

<p>The Corporal tried to open the gate but found the
padlock unyielding, and then he gazed at the notice
wistfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder who&rsquo;s bought it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Melia wondered too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope it&rsquo;s an artist,&rdquo; said the Corporal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I. But I expect it isn&rsquo;t. Artists is scarce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, there.&rdquo; The Corporal sighed heavily.
&ldquo;Artists is scarce.&rdquo; There was a strange look in
his eyes and he turned them suddenly upon the duck
pond so that Melia shouldn&rsquo;t notice it.</p>

<p>Across the road, beside the duck pond, was a wooden
bench, sacred to the village elders, none of whom,
however, was in occupation at this moment. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>Corporal pointed to it. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go an&rsquo; set there a minute,&rdquo;
he said in a husky voice. As if she had been a
child he took her by the hand and led her to it.</p>

<p>They sat down and in a moment or two it was as if
the spirit of the place had descended upon them. The
magic hush of evening crept into their blood like a
subtle wine. A strange soft rapture seemed to pervade
the air. The Unseen spoke to them as never
before.</p>

<p>The Corporal took off his hat and wiped the dew
from his forehead. And then with a queer tightening
of the throat and breast he scanned earth and sky.
They seemed marvelous indeed. He felt them speak
to him, to the infinite, submerged senses whose presence
he had hardly suspected. Never had he experienced
such awe as now in the presence of this peace
that passed all understanding.</p>

<p>In a little while the silence of the Corporal began to
trouble Melia. A cold hand crept into his. &ldquo;What
is it, love?&rdquo; she said softly.</p>

<p>Not daring to look at her, he kept his eyes fixed on
the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, love&mdash;tell me?&rdquo; He hardly knew the
voice for hers; not until that moment had he heard
her use it; but it had the power to ease just a little the
intolerable pressure of his thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; he said slowly, at last, &ldquo;whether
it would not have been better never to have been
born.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>She shivered, not at his words, but at the gray look
on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stanning said the night before he went he thought
that taking it altogether it would have been better if
there had never been a human race at all. I&rsquo;ll never
forget that last talk with him, not if I live to be a
hundred&mdash;which I shall not.&rdquo; The Corporal had begun
to think his thoughts aloud. &ldquo;You see, he knew
then that his number was up. I can see him settin&rsquo;
there, Mother, just as you are now, lookin&rsquo; at that old
sunset, his back to that old canal&mdash;the Yser, I think
they call it&mdash;an&rsquo; stinkin&rsquo; it was, fair cruel. &lsquo;Auntie,&rsquo;
he said suddenlike, &lsquo;tell me what brought you into
this?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;No, boy&rsquo;&mdash;just like a child he was as he
set there&mdash;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s for me to ask <i>you</i> that question.
You&rsquo;re a big gun, you know, a shining light; I&rsquo;m a
never-was-er.&rsquo; That seemed to make him laugh; he
was one that could always raise a laugh, even when
he felt most solemn. &lsquo;I come of a long stock of high-nosed
old Methodists,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Always made a thing
they call Conscience their watchword and fetish.
There was a Stanning went to the stake for it in the
time of Bloody Mary; there was another helped Oliver
Cromwell to cut the head off King Charles. A poisonous,
uncomfortable crowd, and all my life they&rsquo;ve
seemed to come back and worry me just at the times
I should have been most pleased to do without them.
People talk about free will&mdash;but there isn&rsquo;t such a
thing, my dear.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I allowed that there wasn&rsquo;t in my case. Then I
told him about Troop Sergeant Major Hollis, who
fought at Waterloo. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;yours is an old
name in the city, older than mine, I dare say.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;according to Bazeley&rsquo;s Annals there was a
William Hollis who was mayor of the borough in the
year of the Spanish Armada.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good for you, Auntie,&rsquo;
he said, chaffing-like; he was a rare one for chaff.
&lsquo;One up to you. Then,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there was William
Hollis who was &ldquo;some&rdquo; poet in the eighteenth century,
who wrote the famous romantic poem, &ldquo;The
Love Lorn Lady of Corfield.&rdquo; Still,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;these
things don&rsquo;t explain you dragging your old bones to
rot out here.&rsquo; &lsquo;They do in a way, though,&rsquo; I said.
&lsquo;When we come up against a big thing it isn&rsquo;t us that
really matters, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s at the back of us. I used
to set in my old garden on The Rise,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;in those
early days when those dirty dogs opposite was just
beginning to wipe their feet on Europe. And I said to
myself, Bill Hollis, how would <i>you</i> like it if they
broke through the fence into your garden, trampling
your young seeds and goose-stepping all over your
roses and your tulips. And I tell you, Jim&mdash;we got
to be very familiar those last few weeks&mdash;it used to
make me fair mad to read in the <i>Tribune</i> what they&rsquo;d
done ... Louvain one time ... Termondy another
... et cetera.... And I kept on settin&rsquo; there day
after day, in my old garden on the top o&rsquo; The Rise,
saying to myself, Hollis, it&rsquo;s no use, me lad, you&rsquo;re go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>ing
into this. You&rsquo;ve failed in every bloody thing so
far, and if you take on this you&rsquo;ll not be man enough
to stick it out. War isn&rsquo;t thinking, it&rsquo;s doing, and
you&rsquo;ve never been a doer, you&rsquo;ve not. Then I read in
the <i>Tribune</i> one morning that they&rsquo;d got Antwerp and
I said to myself, I can&rsquo;t stand this no more. And I
went right away to the Duke of Wellington and had
a liquor up&mdash;but only a mild one, you know&mdash;and
then round the corner to the Recruiting Office and
gave my age as thirty-six and here I am admiring this
bleeding sunset with the eye of an artist.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That made him laugh some more. &lsquo;Well, Auntie,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very proud to have known you and I
hope you&rsquo;ll do me the honor of accepting this as a
keepsake.&rsquo; He unbuttoned his greatcoat and took this
old watch out of his tunic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal paused an instant in his story to follow
the example of his friend. He produced an old-fashioned
gold hunting watch, with J. T. in monogram
at the back, and handed it to Melia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rare good one, Mother,&rdquo; the Corporal&rsquo;s voice
was very low, &ldquo;solid gold.&rdquo; He opened the lid and
showed her the inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To John Torrington, Esquire, from a Humble Admirer
of His Genius, 1859.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Stanning said, &lsquo;I had the luck to buy that in a
pawnshop in Blackhampton long after he was dead,
and if I had had a boy of my own I should like him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>to have kept it as an heirloom, but as I have not I
want you to take it, Auntie, because I know you&rsquo;ll
appreciate it.&rsquo; Somehow, I could tell from the way
he spoke that he was done. I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to refuse
it, although I hadn&rsquo;t a boy or a girl of my own
neither.&rdquo; A huskiness in the Corporal&rsquo;s throat made
it hard to go on for a moment. &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m only thirty-nine,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;and all the best is in me. I don&rsquo;t fancy
having my light put out like this in a wet bog, but it&rsquo;s
got to come, my dear. I hate to think that sometime
to-morrow I shall be as if I had never been.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not
you,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re sickening for the fever.&lsquo; But I
couldn&rsquo;t move him. He&rsquo;d got the hoo-doo. &lsquo;No use
talking about it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but you and I&rsquo;ll never have
that day&rsquo;s fishing in Corfield Weir. I should like you
to have seen my cottage up at Dibley. It&rsquo;s got the
ghost of that old boy.&rsquo; He put his hand on the watch,
Mother, just like this. &lsquo;If there is a heaven for dead
painters, and I doubt it, I&rsquo;d like to sit in John Torrington&rsquo;s
corner on his right hand. You see, I&rsquo;ve
learned all sorts of things, living in his house. I was
getting to know the lights on the Sharrow and the
feel of the clouds&mdash;in all the great Torringtons the
clouds feel like velvet&mdash;and he was going to show me
the way to handle sunlight&mdash;I&rsquo;ve already been twice
across to New York to see &ldquo;An Afternoon in July in
the Valley of the Sharrow,&rdquo; the most wonderful
thing of its kind in existence. You get the view from
my cottage&mdash;his cottage&mdash;at Dibley. I should like you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>to have seen it, Auntie. And then I should like to
have taken you across to New York to show you what
old John made of it. Fancy having to go all the way
to New York to look at it. So like us to be caught on
the hop, in the things that really matter.&rsquo; I give you
my word, Mother, he raised a laugh even then, but of
a sudden his voice went all queer-like. &lsquo;However,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a Mind in this that knows more than we
do.&rsquo; Then the lad began to shiver just as if he had
the ague. And the next day, about the same time,
or mayhap the perishin&rsquo; old sun had gone a bit more
west, I had to go out across No Man&rsquo;s Land to bring
him in ... what there was left of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal ended his strange story as if after all
it didn&rsquo;t much matter. He was quite impersonal, but
Melia sat beside him shivering at the look in his eyes.
Never before had the veil been torn aside in this way.
She was a dull soul, fettered heavily by her limitations,
but sitting there in the growing dusk it came
on her almost with horror that in all those long years
it was the first peep she had had behind the scenes of
his mind. She hadn&rsquo;t realized the kind of man he
was. More than once she had cast it in his face that
he was an idle shack-about. Somehow, there had been
nothing to give her the key to him; and now, miraculously
as it seemed, it had come to her, it was too late.</p>

<p>She had the key to him now. But the sands were
running out in fate&rsquo;s hour glass. She couldn&rsquo;t bear to
look at his thin gray face as the light fell on it, nor at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>his strange eyes fixed on the padlocked gate of the
cottage opposite. Of a sudden the watch slipped
from her shaking hands, and fell lightly in a little
brake of thistles by the end of the bench on which they
sat.</p>

<p>Cautiously and carefully he picked it out. &ldquo;Take
care on it, Mother,&rdquo; he said softly as he put it again
in her hands. &ldquo;I wish we&rsquo;d a little boy as could have
had it. However, we&rsquo;ve not. There was once a
George Hollis who was an artist; I showed you that
picture of his, &ldquo;The Glade above Corfield,&rdquo; the other
day; Jim said it was a good one. John Torrington
one time was his pupil. Don&rsquo;t suppose he was any
relation but it&rsquo;s the same name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia put the watch in the pretty leather bag he
had insisted on buying for her. And then she said
with a horrible clutch in her throat: &ldquo;Bill, promise!
You&rsquo;ll come back ... won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes didn&rsquo;t move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be that lonely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sighed softly like a child who is very tired. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
do what I can, Mother.&rdquo; The voice was gentleness itself.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t know ... she didn&rsquo;t realize ... what
... she ... was....</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HEY sat hand in hand on the bench by the
duck pond until the shadows began to lengthen
along the valley of the Sharrow. For quite a long
time they didn&rsquo;t speak, but at last their reverie was
broken by the sight of a dusty figure with a sack on
its back shambling along the road towards them. It
was the village postman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s bought the cottage opposite?&rdquo; the Corporal
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zur?&rdquo; said the postman.</p>

<p>The Corporal repeated his question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do sey, zur,&rdquo; said the postman in slow, impressive
Doric, &ldquo;the Mayor o&rsquo; Blackhampton has
bought it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;Alderman Munt?&rdquo; The voice of the Corporal
was full of dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Mayor o&rsquo; Blackhampton, zur. Come here the
other day in a motey car to look at it. Large big
genelman in a white hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heart of the Corporal sank. What the hell had
he, of all people, to go buying it for! Somehow the
postman had shattered the queer sad little world in
which they sat. A feeling of desperation came suddenly
upon the Corporal. He rose abruptly from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>the bench. &ldquo;Come on, Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t
get along we&rsquo;ll be late for supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want no supper, Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Corporal was firm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to stop here all night,&rdquo; Melia said as she
rose limply from the bench. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to stop here
forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the desire uppermost in the Corporal
also, but it would not do to admit it.</p>

<p>Down the road, hand in hand, like two children
out late, they trudged in the gathering dusk to Corfield.
It was a perfect evening. Just a little ahead
was one faint star; over to the left in the noble line
of woods that overlooked the river they could hear
the nightingale. Once they stopped and held their
breaths to listen. They saw the rabbits dart from
among the ferns at their feet and run before them
along the white road. The evening pressed ever closer
upon them as they marched slowly on, until, at a turn
in the road, Corfield with its fruit orchards came into
view.</p>

<p>It was a long trek home but they were in no
hurry to get there. By the time they had come to
the old stone bridge which spanned the broad river
and united the country with the town it was quite
dark and the lamps of the city were shining in the
distance.</p>

<p>Midway across the bridge they stopped to take one
last look at the Sharrow gleaming down its valley.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>Since the afternoon this mighty symbol which from
earliest childhood had dominated their every recollection
seemed to have gained in power, in magic and in
mystery.</p>

<h2 id="XXXIII">XXXIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE hard and difficult months wore on. Summer
passed to autumn; Europe was locked in
the most terrible conflict the world had ever seen, but
there was no sign of a decision.</p>

<p>Like Britain herself, Blackhampton was in the war
to the last man and the last shilling. From the moment
the plunge had been taken the conscience and the
will of this brotherhood of free peoples had been in
grim unison behind the action of its government. The
war was no affair of sections or of classes; the issue
was so clear that there was no ground for misunderstanding
it.</p>

<p>For years it had been freely declared that Britain
was past her zenith, that disintegration had already begun,
that England herself was enervated with prosperity.
At the outset the enemy in making war had
counted on the fact too confidently. Britain would
not dare to enter the struggle, she who was suffering
from fatty degeneration of the soul, or if in the end
she was driven into the whirlpool in spite of herself
she would prove a broken reed in this strife for human
freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>These were dangerous heresies, even for a race of
supermen, and nowhere in the oldest of free communities
was the task of dispelling it undertaken more
vigorously than in Blackhampton. As its archives
bore witness it had a long and proud record. No
matter what great national movement had been afoot
in the past, Blackhampton, the central city of England,
geographically speaking, had invariably reacted to it
with force and urgency.</p>

<p>Among the many virile men who strove to meet a
supreme occasion, none deserved better of his country,
or of his fellow citizens than Mr. Josiah Munt. He
was of a type suited beyond all others to deal with
the more obvious needs of a time that called for the
unsparing use of every energy; he had a genius of a
plain, practical, ruthless kind; he was the incarnation
of &ldquo;carry on&rdquo; and &ldquo;get things done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the first hour he took off his coat and buckled
to. He worked like a leviathan. No day was too long
for him, no labor too arduous; his methods were
rough and now and again the clatter he made was a
little out of proportion to the amount of weight he
pulled in the boat. His life had been one of limited
opportunity, but he had a knack of seeing the thing
to be done and of doing it. People soon began to realize
that he was the right man in the right place, and
that as a driving force he was a great asset to the city
of Blackhampton.</p>

<p>The war was about fifteen months&rsquo; old when Alder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>man
Munt was chosen mayor of Blackhampton. He
took up an office that was by no means a sinecure at a
very critical moment. But it was soon clear that a
wise choice had been made; a certain Britishness of
character of the right bulldog breed did much to keep
a population of two hundred and eighty-six thousand
souls &ldquo;up to the collar.&rdquo; Somehow, the rude force
and the native honesty of the man appealed to the
popular imagination; if a prophet is ever honored in
his own country it is in time of war.</p>

<p>During his mayoralty Josiah Munt came to occupy
a place in the minds of his own people that none could
have predicted. When the grim hour struck which
altered the face of the world and changed the whole
aspect of human society few could have been found
to say a word in favor of the proprietor of the Duke
of Wellington. He had begun low down, in a common
part of the town; and, although there was really
nothing against him, his name was never in specially
good odor, perhaps for the reason that he bore obvious
marks of his origin and because the curves of
his mind were too broad for him to care very much
about concealing them. In the general opinion he
had been a very &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; man, financially successful
beyond his merits, and for that reason arrogant. But
in the throes of the upheaval preconceived ideas were
soon shed if they did not happen to square with the
facts; and it took considerably less than a year for
Josiah to prove to his fellow townsmen that the god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>dess
Fortune is not always the capricious fool she has
the name of being.</p>

<p>Even in the stress of a terribly strenuous twelve
months the Mayor of Blackhampton, like the wise
man he was, insisted upon taking his annual fortnight&rsquo;s
holiday at Bridlington. He had not missed his
annual fortnight at Bridlington once in the last thirty
years. It did him so much good, he was able to
work so much the better for it afterwards, that, as
he informed Mr. Aylett the Town Clerk, on the eve
of departure in the second week of August, &ldquo;it would
take more than the likes o&rsquo; the Kaiser to keep him
from the seaside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like a giant refreshed the Mayor returned to his
civic duties at the end of the month. His leisure at
Bridlington had been enlivened by the company of
the Mayoress, by Mrs. Doctor Cockburn and her two
children, and also by Miss Gertrude Preston, who for
quite a number of years now had helped to beguile
the tedium of her brother-in-law&rsquo;s annual rest cure.</p>

<p>As soon as the Mayor returned to the scene of his
labors he found there was one very important question
he would have to decide. In his absence the City
fathers had met several times to discuss the matter of
his successor and had come, in some cases perhaps reluctantly,
to the conclusion that none but himself could
be his peer. According to the aldermanic roster, Mr.
Limpenny the maltster was next in office, but that
wise man was the first to own that he had not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>driving power, or the breadth of appeal of the present
mayor.</p>

<p>In ordinary times that would not have mattered,
but the times were very far from ordinary. War
was making still sterner demands, week by week, upon
every man and woman in the country. Blackhampton
had done much, as every town in England had, but
its temporal directors felt that no effort must be relaxed,
and that it was ever increasingly their duty &ldquo;to
keep it up to the collar.&rdquo; And Josiah Munt now filled
the popular mind.</p>

<p>The very qualities which in the gentler days, not so
long ago, had aroused antagonism were at a premium
now. For superfine people the Mayor was a full-blooded
representative of a distressing type, but it
was now the reign of King Demos: all over the island
from Westminster itself to the parish hall of Little
Pedlington-in-the-Pound the Josiah Munts of the
earth had come at last by their own. On every public
platform and in every newspaper was to be found a
Josiah Munt haranguing the natives at the top of his
voice, thereby guaranteeing his political vision and his
mental capacity. King Demos is not a rose born to
blush unseen; he knows everything about everything
and he is not ashamed to say so. With a fraction of
his colossal mind he can conduct the most delicate and
far-reaching military operations, involving millions of
men, and countless tons of machinery to which even
a Napoleon or a Clausewitz might be expected to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>his undivided attention; with another he is able to insure
that the five million dogs of the island, mainly
untaxed, shall continue to pollute the unscavengered
streets of its most populous cities; with another he is
able to devise a Ministry of Health; with another he
can pick his way through the maze of world politics,
and recast the map of Europe and Asia on a basis to
endure until the crack of doom; with yet another he
can devise a new handle for the parish pump.</p>

<p>King Demos is indeed a bright fellow. And in Mr.
Josiah Munt he found an ideal representative. Happily
for Blackhampton, although there were places
of even greater importance who in this respect were
not so well off, he was a man of rude honesty. He
said what he meant and he meant what he said; he
was no believer in graft, he did not willfully mislead;
he was not a seeker of cheap applause; and in matters
of the public purse he had a certain amount of public
conscience. As Mr. Aylett the town clerk said in the
course of a private conversation with Mr. Druce the
chairman of the Finance Committee, &ldquo;His worship is
not everybody&rsquo;s pretty boy, but just now we are lucky
to have him and we ought to be thankful that he is
the clean potato.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore, within a week of his return from Bridlington,
the Mayor was met by the request of the City
fathers that he should take office for another year.
Josiah was flattered by the compliment, but he felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>that it was not a matter he could decide offhand.
&ldquo;He must talk to the wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At dinner that evening at Strathfieldsaye, when the
question was mooted, the hapless Maria was overcome.
Only heaven knew, if heaven did know, how
she had contrived to fill the part of a Mayoress for
so many trying months. She had simply been counting
the days when she could retire into that life of
privacy, from which by no desire of her own had she
emerged. It was too cruel that the present agony
should be prolonged for another year, and although
her tremulous lips dare not say so her eyes spoke for
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Mother?&rdquo; His worship proudly
took a helping of potatoes.</p>

<p>Maria did not say anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A compliment, you know. Limpenny&rsquo;s next in,
but the Council is unanimous in asking me to keep on.
I don&rsquo;t know that I want to, it&rsquo;s terrible work, great
responsibility and it costs money; but, between you
and me, I don&rsquo;t see who is going to do it better.
Comes to that, I don&rsquo;t see who is going to do it as
well. Limpenny&rsquo;s a gentleman and all that, college
bred and so on, but he&rsquo;s not the man somehow. Give
Limpenny his due, he knows that. He button-holed
me this morning after the meeting of the Council.
&lsquo;Mr. Mayor,&rsquo; he said&mdash;Limpenny&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; those precise
think-before-you-speak sort o&rsquo; people&mdash;&lsquo;I do hope
you&rsquo;ll continue in office. To my mind you&rsquo;re the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>man in the right place.&rsquo; I thought that very decent
of Limpenny. Couldn&rsquo;t have spoken fairer, could
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hapless Maria gave an audible sniff and discontinued
the eating of war beef.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mother, what do you say? The Council
seems to think that I&rsquo;ve got the half nelson on this
town. So Aylett said. A bit of a wag in his way, is
that Aylett. He said I&rsquo;d got two hundred and eighty-six
thousand people feeding from the hand. That&rsquo;s
an exaggeration, but I see what he means; and he&rsquo;s
a man of considerable municipal experience. Smartest
town clerk in England, they tell me. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all very
well, Mr. Aylett,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll have to talk to the
Mayoress. And I&rsquo;ll let you have an answer to-morrow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hapless Maria declined gooseberry fool proffered
by the respectful Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to be eating, Mother,&rdquo; said his worship.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you well? I expect it&rsquo;s the weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria thought it must be the weather; at any rate
it could be nothing else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want a bit more air, I think,&rdquo; said Josiah in the
midst of a royal helping of a favorite delicacy. &ldquo;Just
roll back those sunblinds, Alice, and let in a bit o&rsquo;
daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sphinx-like Alice carried out the order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And open the doors a bit wider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice impassively obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like a nip of brandy? The weather, I
suppose. Very hot to-day. Temperature nearly a
hundred this morning in the Council Chamber. We&rsquo;ll
have some new ventilators put in there or I&rsquo;ll know
the reason. At the best of times there&rsquo;s a great deal
too much hot air in the Council Chamber. And when
you get a hot summer on the top of it...! Alice,
go and get some brandy for the Mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Exit Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better when you&rsquo;ve had a drop of
brandy. Antiquated things those ventilators at the
City Hall. Aylett thinks they&rsquo;ve been there since the
time of Queen Anne. But they&rsquo;re not the only things
I&rsquo;m going to scrap if I hold office another year.
There&rsquo;s too much flummery and red tape round about
Corporation Square. Tradition is all very well but
we want something practical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice entered with a decanter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;ll put you right. A little meat for the
Mistress, Alice. Never mind the soda. It&rsquo;ll not hurt
you, Mother. Prime stuff is that and prime stuff
never does harm to no one. Some I&rsquo;ve had by me
at the Duke of Wellington for many a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first the Mayoress was very shy of the brandy,
prime stuff though it was, but his worship was adamant,
and after a moment or two of half-hearted resistance
Maria seemed the better for her lord&rsquo;s inflexibility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talkin&rsquo; of the Duke of Wellington ... funny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>how things work out! When we went in there in &rsquo;79,
you and me, we little thought we should be where we
are now, in the most important time in history. That
reminds me. Alice, just ring up the <i>Tribune</i> Office
and give the editor my compliments and tell him I&rsquo;ve
arranged to speak to-morrow at the Gas Works at
twelve o&rsquo;clock and they had better send a reporter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice!&ldquo;</p>

<p>Alice halted sphinx-like at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. I&rsquo;ll go myself!&rdquo; Josiah plucked
his table napkin out of his collar. &ldquo;Nothing like doing
a thing while it&rsquo;s fresh in your mind. And do
it yourself if you want it done right. I must have
a word with Parslow the editor. The jockey he sent
to Jubilee Park to report the flower show didn&rsquo;t know
his business. The most important part of the speech
was left out.&rdquo; He laid down his table napkin and
rose determinedly. &ldquo;Nice thing in a time like this
for the Mayor of the City not to be fully reported.
I&rsquo;ve half a mind to tell that Parslow what I think
of him. Some people don&rsquo;t seem to know there&rsquo;s a
war on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Five minutes later when Josiah returned in triumph
to his gooseberries he found Maria reclining on the
sofa with her feet up, next the window opening on to
the spacious lawns of Strathfieldsaye. The impassive
but assiduous handmaid was fanning her mistress
with a handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Alice!&rdquo; Josiah sat down with an
air of satisfaction. He was not indifferent to the
sufferings of Maria, but of recent years she seemed
to have developed a susceptibility to climatic conditions
perhaps a little excessive for the wife of one who
at heart was still a plain man. She had a proneness
to whims and fancies now which in robuster days was
lacking. He could only ascribe it to a kind of misplaced
fineladyism, and he didn&rsquo;t quite approve it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I spoke pretty straight to the <i>Tribune</i> ... to the
subeditor. I said I hoped they fully realized their
duty to the public and also to the Empire, but that
I sometimes doubted it. He seemed a bit huffed, I
thought ... but you&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;ll be reported to-morrow
all right. I&rsquo;ll look after your mistress, Alice. Go and
get the coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Alice returned with the coffee she found the
Mayor vigorously fanning the Mayoress with a table
napkin, and she was peremptorily ordered &ldquo;to nip upstairs
for a bottle of sal volatile.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="XXXIV">XXXIV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was honest satisfaction in the town when
it was known that the Mayor had consented to
remain another year in office. Most people agreed
that it was a good thing for Blackhampton. But the
Mayoress took to her bed.</p>

<p>Could she have had her way she would never have
got up again. For many years now life had been a
nightmare of ever-growing duties, of ever-increasing
responsibilities. Her conservative temperament resisted
change. She had not wanted to leave the Duke
of Wellington for the comparative luxury of Waterloo
Villa, she had not wanted to leave Waterloo Villa
for the defiant grandeur of Strathfieldsaye. When
she was faced with a whole year as Mayoress she fully
expected to die of it, and perhaps she would have died
of it but for the oblique influence of Gertrude Preston;
but now she was threatened with a further twelve months
of the same embarrassing public grandeur she
was compelled to review her attitude towards an early
demise.</p>

<p>Maria knew that if she allowed her light to be put
out Gerty had the makings of a highly qualified successor.
No one was better at shaking hands with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>grandee, no one had a happier knack of saying the
right word at the right time; and neither the Mayor
nor the Mayoress, particularly the latter, knew what
they would have done without her. Gerty, in fact,
had become a kind of unofficial standard bearer and
henchwoman of a great man. Every piece of gossip
she heard about him was faithfully reported, every
paragraph that appeared in the paper was brought to
his notice, she flattered him continually and made him
out to be no end of a fellow; and in consequence poor
Maria was bitten with such a furious jealousy that
she would like to have killed her designing but indispensable
step-sister.</p>

<p>When Maria took to her bed, the Mayor promptly
requested the accomplished Gertrude to do what she
could in the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Josiah, she must show Spirit.&rdquo; As always that
was her specific for the hapless Maria, and at the request
of his worship she went at once to the big bedroom,
from whose large bay windows a truly noble
view of the whole city and the open country beyond
was to be obtained, and as Josiah himself expressed
it, &ldquo;proceeded to read the riot act to the Mayoress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayoress was in bed, therefore she had to take
it lying down. For that matter it was her nature to
take all things lying down. But in her heart she had
never so deeply resented the obtrusion of Gerty as
at this moment. She wanted never to get up any
more, but if she didn&rsquo;t get up any more this meddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>some
and dangerous rival would do as she liked with
Josiah, and in all human probability as soon as the
lawful Mayoress was decently and comfortably in her
grave she would marry him.</p>

<p>It was really Gerty who kept the Mayoress going;
not by the crude method of personal admonition, however
forcible its use, but by the subtle spur that one
mind may exert upon another. Maria had to choose
between showing spirit and allowing the odious Gerty
to wear the dubious mantle of her grandeur.</p>

<p>Hard was the choice, but Mother Eve prevailed in
the weak flesh of the lawful Mayoress. She made a
silent vow that Gerty should not marry Josiah if she
could possibly help it. Yes, she would show spirit.
Cruel as the alternative was, she would be Mayoress
a second year. Even if she died of it, and in her
present frame of mind she rather hoped she would,
she alone should sit in the chair of honor at the Annual
Meeting of the British Women&rsquo;s Tribute to the
Memory of Queen Boadicea, she alone should take
precedence of the local duchess and the county ladies
at the annual bazaar in aid of the Society for Providing
Black and White Dogs with Brown Biscuits.</p>

<p>Maria, however, in her present low state, consented
to Gerty deputizing for her at the review of the Girl
Scouts in the Arboretum. She was reluctant to make
even that minor concession&mdash;it was the thin end of
the wedge!&mdash;but it had been intimated to Josiah that
the Mayoress was always expected to say a few words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>on this spirited occasion. This was altogether too
much for Maria in the present condition of her health.</p>

<p>Before the Girl Scouts, Gerty bore herself in a manner
that even Miss Heber-Knollys, the august principal
of the High School for Young Ladies, who was
present, a perfect dragon of silent criticism, could
hardly have improved upon. The Mayor at any rate
was delighted with his sister-in-law&rsquo;s performance,
drove her back in triumph to Strathfieldsaye and insisted
on her staying to dinner.</p>

<p>The hapless Maria, after nearly three weeks of the
peace and sanctity of her chamber, had struggled down
to tea for the first time. She sat forlornly in the drawing-room,
a white woolen shawl over her ample shoulders.
It had been a real relief to allow Gerty to deputize
for her, but now that the hour of trial was past
Maria was inclined to despise, for the moment at any
rate, the human weakness that had played into the
hands of a highly dangerous schemer. It would have
been so easy to have done it oneself, after all; it was
such a simple thing, now that it was safely over!</p>

<p>Gerty consumed a pickelet and drank two cups of
tea with an air of rectitude, while Josiah recited the
story of the afternoon for the delectation of Maria.
He was so well satisfied with the performance of the
deputy that the lawful Mayoress began to scent danger.
&ldquo;Gert says,&rdquo; the Mayor informed her, &ldquo;that if
you don&rsquo;t feel up to it she&rsquo;ll distribute the prizes on
the Fifth, at the Floral Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mayoress drew in her lips, a sign that she was
thinking. She <i>might</i> be able to manage the Fifth, as
&ldquo;a few words&rdquo; were not expected, although, of course,
they were always welcome.</p>

<p>Josiah, however, was not inclined to press the matter.
Maria seemed rather worried by her duties as
Mayoress and Gerty having had greater experience in
that kind of thing and having already done extremely
well in the Arboretum, it now occurred to the Mayor
that it might be possible to arrange with the Town
Clerk for her to take over the duties permanently in
his second year of office. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say the Council will
consent,&rdquo; said Josiah. &ldquo;It may be a bit irregular.
But they know you&rsquo;re not strong, Mother. I was
careful to tell them that when I consented to keep the
job on. So the way is paved for you, as you might
say, if you really don&rsquo;t feel up to it. Anyhow, I&rsquo;ll
hear what Aylett has to say about it. No man in
England, they tell me, is a safer guide in matters of
municipal practice. If Aylett thinks it will be all right,
I&rsquo;m sure Gerty won&rsquo;t mind acting as Mayoress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delighted, Josiah!&rdquo; Gerty&rsquo;s bow and smile were
positively regal; they were modeled, in point of fact,
upon those of Princess Mawdwin of Connemara, the
most celebrated bazaar-opener of the period.</p>

<p>The Mayoress drew in her lips still further. She
began to think very seriously. No human Mayoress
could have been in lower spirits or have felt less equal
to her duties than did Maria at that moment, but if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>Gerty was allowed to usurp the honors and the dignities
so indubitably hers it would be very hard to bear.
The whole thing was so like Gerty. Always a
schemer; in spite of her soft manners and her pussy-cat
ways, always at heart a grabber. The Mayoress
felt that if the weak state of her health called for a
deputy, and really it seemed to do so, she would have
preferred the Queen of Sheba herself to the designing
Gertrude. For years she had been able to twist
Josiah round her little finger. So like a man to be
taken in by her! So like a man not to be able to
see what a Fox of a woman she really was.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Maria had reason to fear that she
was very ill, indeed. She was afraid of her heart.
It is true that three times within the past fortnight
Horace, Doctor Cockburn, had solemnly assured his
mother-in-law that there was nothing the matter with
it. But thinking the matter over, as day after day
she lay in her miserable bed, she had come to the
conclusion that Horace was a modern doctor and that
a modern doctor could hardly be expected to understand
that old-fashioned organ, the heart.</p>

<p>She had made up her mind, therefore, to have a
second opinion. She would go to a heart specialist,
a man who really knew about hearts. As a fact she
had already made up her mind to have the opinion of
Dr. Tremlett who humored her, who understood her
system and its ways. Horace, who was so modern,
rather smiled at Dr. Tremlett&mdash;he was careful not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>go beyond a smile at Doctor Tremlett, although his
demeanor almost suggested that he might have done
so had not etiquette intervened.</p>

<p>The Mayoress, therefore, was now placed in a difficult
position by the success of a base intriguer. She
didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Three days ago her mind
had been made up that she would put herself in the
hands of Doctor Tremlett, but if she did that she was
quite sure that Doctor Tremlett, a physician of the old
school who knew how important the heart was in
every human anatomy and therefore treated it with
the utmost respect, would not allow her to go overdoing
it. Her time would be divided between her bed
and the drawing-room sofa; he would most probably
insist on a trained nurse&mdash;Doctor Tremlett really respected
the heart&mdash;and the trained nurse would mean,
of course, that the Mayoress had abdicated and that
the way was open for the treacherous Gertrude with
her pussy-cat ways to take over the duties permanently.</p>

<p>It was a dilemma. And it was made needlessly
painful for the Mayoress by the blindness and folly of
the Mayor; in some ways so very able, in others he
was such a shortsighted man! Really, he ought to
have seen what Gerty was up to. So like a man to
be completely taken in by her. One of her own sex
would have seen at a glance that Gertrude was a
Deep one.</p>

<p>It was a most difficult moment for the Mayoress.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>Either she must be false to Doctor Tremlett and give
up her heart or she would have to submit tamely to
the rape of her grandeur and have it flaunted in her
face by a Designing creature. Heaven knew that she
had no taste herself for grandeur, but Gerty had a
very decided taste for it and there was the rub!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a piece of this excellent pickelet, Josiah!&rdquo;
That smile and that manner were very winning to
some eyes no doubt, but those of Maria were not of
the number. That coat and skirt, how well they hung
upon her! Gerty had always had a slim figure. Some
people thought her figure very genteel, but again Maria
was not of the number. Some people also thought
her voice was very ladylike&mdash;Josiah did for one. La-di-da
the Mayoress called it. Simpering creature!
Even if the pickelet was excellent it didn&rsquo;t need her
to say so. What had she to do with the pickelet? And
there was Josiah submitting to her like a lamb and
talking to her about the Town Clerk and the City
Council and wondering whether she would mind giving
him a hand on the Fifth at the Floral Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be delighted, Josiah&mdash;simply delighted. Anything
to help. If I can be the slightest use to you&mdash;and
to Maria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That precious, &ldquo;And to Maria,&rdquo; brought a curl to
the lip of the lawful Mayoress. Designing hussy!
So like a man not to see through her. Maria felt herself
slowly turning green. The heart has been known
to take people that way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gert is staying to dinner, Mother. Hope Billing
sent up that salmon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billing had sent up the salmon, the Mayor was
meekly informed by the Mayoress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chose it myself. Looked a good fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful to me, Josiah&rdquo;&mdash;affected mouncing
minx!&mdash;&ldquo;how you manage to get through your day.
You seem to have time for everything. Why, your
work as mayor alone would keep most people fully
occupied. Yet you always seem able to attend personally
to this and that and the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, Gert.&rdquo; Some of the great man&rsquo;s
critics were inclined to think that since he had made
so good in his high office his amazing self-confidence
had abated a feather or two. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always tried to
be what I call a prattical man. If you want a thing
done right do it yourself&mdash;that&rsquo;s my motto.&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you get through so much, Josiah.&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a habit. But there&rsquo;s a very busy year ahead.
Being Mayor o&rsquo; this city is not child&rsquo;s play in times
like these. We&rsquo;re up against the food shortage now.
Last year it was munitions. Next year it&rsquo;ll be coal.
And the Army&rsquo;s always crying out for men. And
any labor that isn&rsquo;t in khaki is that durned independent
and very inefficient into the bargain. The papers
are always writing up what they call democracy. Well,
you can have all my share of democracy. Between
you and me, Gert, it&rsquo;s mainly a name for a lot of
jumped-up ignoramuses who have no idea of how lit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>tle
they do know. Yesterday I was over at Cleveley
arranging with the Duke about a certain matter. Now
he&rsquo;s prattical fellow, is that. He said, &lsquo;Mr. Munt, to
be candid, I don&rsquo;t know anything about the subject,
but I&rsquo;m very willing to learn.&rsquo; I tell you, Gert, you&rsquo;d
have to wait till the cows come home to hear one of
our jumped-up Jacks-in-Office talking that way.
There&rsquo;s nothing they don&rsquo;t know and they&rsquo;re not afraid
to say so. Why, it even takes <i>me</i> all my time to tell
them anything.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="XXXV">XXXV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>T this critical moment Ethel came in. Mrs. Doctor Cockburn
was raging secretly. She had
turned up at the Arboretum, dutifully prepared to
help her mother through a situation a little trying
perhaps to the nerve of inexperience and behold! there
was Gertrude, smiling and pat, going through it all
without turning a hair and palpably not in need of
the least assistance from any one. The mortified
Ethel, having missed a Sunday at Strathfieldsaye, had
not been in a position to realize that her mother was
going to be so weak as to allow Gerty, who as usual
had masked her intentions very cleverly, to take her
place. It was such a pity! Miss Heber-Knollys who
was there, had said it was such a pity!</p>

<p>Ethel, an old and successful pupil of that distinguished
lady, had been carried off to tea by her at
the end of the proceedings. And Miss Heber-Knollys
had expressed herself as a little disappointed. She
was sure the Girl Scouts had been so looking forward
to having the Mayoress with them that afternoon;
at any rate, Miss Heber-Knollys had, although of
course she had no pretensions to speak for the Girl
Scouts; but speaking as a public, a semi-public woman
of Blackhampton, although born in Kent and edu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>cated
at Girham, speaking therefore, as a quasi-public
and naturalized woman of Blackhampton with an
M.A. degree, she looked to the Mayoress to take a
strong lead in all matters relating to the many-sided
activities of the City&rsquo;s feminine life.</p>

<p>Ethel quite saw that. And she now proceeded fully
and pointedly to report Miss Heber-Knollys for the
future guidance of her father, the admonition of her
mother and for the confusion and general undoing of
the designing Gertrude. Mrs. Doctor Cockburn was
far from realizing the critical nature of the moment
at which she had chanced to arrive, but the general
effect of her presence was just as stimulating as if
she had. The lawful Mayoress was in sore need of
mental and moral support if she was to prevail against
the Schemer.</p>

<p>Ethel was in the nick of time, but yet it was by no
means certain that she was not too late to keep Gerty
from the Floral Hall. The Floral Hall would depend
on Doctor Tremlett, bluntly remarked Josiah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Tremlett!&rdquo; said Mrs. Doctor Cockburn
sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your man has got the sack.&rdquo; The Mayor indulged
in an obvious wink at Gerty who was looking as if
butter would not melt in her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the horrified Ethel, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no comparison
between Horace and Doctor Tremlett. Horace
belongs to the modern school; Doctor Tremlett&rsquo;s
an old fossil.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Ma seems to think Doctor Tremlett understands
her,&rdquo; said Josiah bluntly. &ldquo;And Doctor Tremlett
says she&rsquo;s got to be very careful of her heart or
she&rsquo;ll have to lie up and have a trained nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Horace declares there is nothing the matter
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where Horace don&rsquo;t know his business as
well as Doctor Tremlett. Your Ma has got to be very
careful, indeed, and I&rsquo;m going to arrange with Aylett
for her to have a deputy for the whole of the coming
year. You see if anything happened to her she&rsquo;d <i>have</i>
to have a deputy, so it may be wise to take steps beforehand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Father! Horace says there&rsquo;s nothing
the matter with her. He says it&rsquo;s stage fright. You
ought not to encourage her. Certainly it isn&rsquo;t right
that Gerty should be taking her place. Miss Heber-Knollys
says it may make a bad impression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure, what business it is of hers.&rdquo;
His worship spoke with considerable asperity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, if any one must deputize, surely it should
be me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a little pause and then said Gerty in her
meek and dovelike voice, &ldquo;We all thought, dear, that
just now you would not care to take part in a public
display. Perhaps after Christmas ... when the new
little one has safely arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other ladies realized that the Fox of a Gertrude
had scored a bull&rsquo;s-eye. At Christmas it was fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>ly
hoped in the family that the Mayor would at last
have a grandson. Certainly, Mrs. Doctor could not be
expected to take an active part at the Floral Hall.</p>

<p>There were occasions, however, when Mrs. Doctor
was visited by some of her father&rsquo;s driving force and
power of will. And this was one of them. If a calamity
of the first magnitude was to be averted&mdash;Gerty
as Deputy-Mayoress was unthinkable!&mdash;there
must be no half measure. &ldquo;Horace says it will do
Mother good to distribute the prizes at the Floral Hall,
and if she doesn&rsquo;t I am sure that quite a lot of people
will be disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even for Ethel this was rather cynical. She was
well aware that she had greatly overrated the public&rsquo;s
power of disappointment; at the same time it was
clearly a case for strong action. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go to the
Floral Hall, Mother. And I&rsquo;ll come with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>, dear?&rdquo; Gerty spoke in a melodramatic
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall sit just behind her ... in the second row.
We can&rsquo;t have people talking. And I shall put on my
fur coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a blow on the sconce for the specious Gertrude,
but she took it with disarming meekness, smiling,
as Ethel mentally described her, &ldquo;like a prize Angora&rdquo;
down her long, straight, rather adventurous
nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your duty, Mother.&rdquo; Mrs. Doctor proceeded
to administer a mental and moral shaking. &ldquo;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>women of the city look up to you, they expect you to
set an example. Miss Heber-Knollys feels that very
strongly. And Horace, who is a far cleverer man than
Doctor Tremlett, says all you have to do is to keep
yourself up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words, Maria,&rdquo; cooed Gerty in the voice
of the dove, &ldquo;you must show Spirit. And that is what
I always tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were times when Gerty was amazing. Her
audacity took away the breath even of Ethel. As for
Maria she felt a little giddy. She was fascinated.</p>

<p>The She serpent.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XXXVI">XXXVI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ARIA went to the Floral Hall. And she was
seen there to great advantage. She wore a
new hat chosen for her by Ethel at the most fashionable
shop in the city; she distributed the prizes to
the Orphans&rsquo; Guild in a manner which extorted praise
from even the diminished Gertrude; she didn&rsquo;t actually
&ldquo;say a few words,&rdquo; but her good heart&mdash;speaking
figuratively of course&mdash;and her motherly presence
spoke for her; and as Miss Heber-Knollys said, in felicitously
proposing a vote of thanks to the Mayoress
on whose behalf the Mayor responded, she had brought
a ray of sunshine into the lives of those who saw
the sun too seldom.</p>

<p>This achievement was a facer for the designing
Gertrude, also for the antiquated Doctor Tremlett.
On the other hand, it was a triumph for Ethel and
for the modern school of medicine. Horace, Doctor
Cockburn, was reinstated. Maria would still have
felt safer with some one who really understood the
heart and its ways, but, as Ethel pointed out to her,
she would earn the admiration of everybody if she
could manage to postpone her really serious illness
until the following year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Maria, at any rate, was open to reason. For the
sake of the general life of the community she would
do her best. But it was very hard upon her; far
harder than people realized. As she had once pathetically
told Josiah, &ldquo;she hadn&rsquo;t been brought up to that
kind of thing,&rdquo; to which the Mayor promptly rejoined,
&ldquo;that he hadn&rsquo;t either, but he was as good as some
who had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Education was what the Mayor called a flam. In
the main it wasn&rsquo;t prattical. He allowed that it was
useful in certain ways and in carefully regulated
doses, but of late years it had been ridiculously overdone
and was in a fair way to ruin the country. Education
didn&rsquo;t agree with everybody. He knew a case
in point.</p>

<p>A classical instance of schooling misapplied would
always remain in his mind. There were times when
he brooded over this particular matter in secret, for
he never spoke of it openly. His youngest girl, upon
whose upbringing a fabulous sum had been lavished,
had cast such a blot on the family escutcheon that
it was almost impossible to forgive her. It was all
very well for Ethel to talk of Sally&rsquo;s doings in Serbia.
That seemed the best place for people like her. Yet,
as a matter of strict equity, and Josiah was a just man,
although a harsh one, he supposed that presently he
would have to do something in the matter.</p>

<p>Under the surface he was a good deal troubled by
Sally. She was out of his will and he had fully made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>up his mind to have nothing more to do with her;
she had had carte blanche in the matter of learning,
and the only use she had made of it was to disgrace
him in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>All that, however, was before the war. And there
was no doubt that the war had altered things. Before
the war he lived for money and worldly reputation;
but now that he was in the thick of the fight
some of his ideas had changed. Money, for instance,
seemed to matter far less than formerly; and he had
come to see that the only kind of worldly reputation
worth having didn&rsquo;t depend upon externals. His
success as a public man had taught him that. It
wasn&rsquo;t his fine house on The Rise, or the fact that
he had become one of the richest men in the city, that
had caused him to be unanimously invited to carry on
for another year. Other qualities had commended
him. He didn&rsquo;t pretend to be what he was not, and
the people of the soundest judgment seemed to like
him all the better on that account.</p>

<p>He was beginning to see now that the case of Sally
would have to be reconsidered. In spite of the damnable
independence which had always been hers from
the time she was as high as the dining-room table,
there was no doubt that she was now fighting hard
for a cause worth fighting for. He had not reached
the point of telling Mossop to put her back in his
will, but the conviction was growing upon him that
he would have to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time it was going to hurt. He could
have wished now that he hadn&rsquo;t been quite so hasty
in the matter. It was not his way to indulge in vain
regrets or to pay much attention to unsolicited advice,
but it seemed a pity that he had not listened to
Mossop in the first instance. This business of Sally,
in a manner of speaking, would be in the nature of
a public climb down. And there had been one already.</p>

<p>As far as Melia and her husband were concerned
his conscience pricked him more than a little. At first
it had gone sorely against the grain to revoke the ban
upon his contemptuously defiant eldest daughter and
his former barman. But once having done so, it had
come suddenly upon him that he had gone wrong in
that affair from the outset. The provocation had been
great, but he had let his feelings master him. Melia
and Hollis were not exonerated. She ought to have
shown more respect for his wishes, and a man in the
position of Hollis ought to prove himself before he
ventures to ask for his employer&rsquo;s daughter; but, if he
had to deal with the episode again, he felt, in the
light of later experience, that he would have acted
differently.</p>

<p>However, by the end of November, Josiah had made
up his mind to restore Melia and Sally to his will.
It was only a question of when he should do so. But
this was a matter in which his usual power of volition
seemed to desert him. In other affairs of life
to decide on a thing was at once to do it; but now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>he hesitated, putting off from day to day. It was a
dose of particularly disagreeable medicine that there
seemed no immediate need to swallow.</p>

<p>A day soon came, however, when he was rather bitterly
to rue his vacillation. One morning Josiah arrived
at the City Hall at a quarter to ten. A meeting
of the Ways and Means Committee was called
for a quarter past and he had to take the chair in the
Mayor&rsquo;s parlor. When he entered the room he found
the Town Clerk standing in front of a fire of the Best
Blackhampton Bright, a twinkle in his eye and a formidable
sheaf of documents in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Mayor." Perhaps a faintly
quizzical greeting, respectful though it was. But this
shrewd dog Aylett, with a pair of humorous eyes
looking through gold-rimmed glasses which hung by a
cord from his neck, had a slightly quizzical manner
with everybody. He knew his value to the city of
Blackhampton; he was the ablest Town Clerk it had
ever had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Aylett,&rdquo; said his worship in that official
voice which seemed to get deeper and deeper at every
meeting over which he presided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve read your <i>Tribune</i> this morning?&rdquo;
Aylett had an easy chatty way with everybody
from the Mayor down. He was so well used to high
affairs that he could be slightly jocular without impairing
the dignity of a grandee and without loss of
his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Mayor.
&ldquo;The girl forgot to deliver it this morning at Strathfieldsaye.
Don&rsquo;t know, Aylett, what things are coming
to in this city, I don&rsquo;t really. We&rsquo;ll have to have
an alteration if we are not going to lose the war altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Town Clerk smiled at this, and then he took
the municipal copy of the <i>Tribune</i> from among other
works of reference on a side table, folded back the
page and handed the paper to the Mayor. &ldquo;That
youngest girl of yours has been going it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate piece of phrasing on the part
of one so accomplished as Aylett. Josiah started a
little and then with an air of rather grim anxiety proceeded
to read the <i>Tribune</i>.</p>

<p>There was three quarters of a column devoted to
the doings of Miss Sarah Ann Munt; a sight which,
with certain sinister recollections in his mind, went
some way to assure Josiah that his worst fears were
realized. But he had but to read a line or so to be convinced
that there was no ground for pessimism. Miss
Sarah Ann Munt, it seemed, had rendered such signal
service to the Allied Cause that she had brought
great honor upon herself, upon a name highly and
justly esteemed in the city of Blackhampton, and even
upon the country of her origin.</p>

<p>The <i>Tribune</i> told the thrilling story of her deeds
with pardonable gusto. On the outbreak of war she
had volunteered for service with the Serbian Army.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>Owing to her great skill as a motor driver, for which
in pre-war days she had been noted, she had been
attached in that capacity to the Headquarters Staff.
She had endured the perils and the hardships of the
long retreat; and her coolness, her daring and her
mother wit had enabled her to bring her car, containing
the Serbian Commander and his Chief of Staff,
in safety through the enemy lines at a moment when
they had actually been cut off. &ldquo;It is not too much to
say,&rdquo; declared the <i>Tribune</i> whose language was official,
&ldquo;that the story of Miss Munt&rsquo;s deeds in Serbia
is one of the epics of the war. By her own personal
initiative she did much to avert a disaster of the first
magnitude. No single individual since the war began
has rendered a more outstanding service to the
Allied Cause. She has already been the recipient of
more than one high decoration, and on page five will
be found an official photograph of her receiving yet
another last week in Paris from the hands of the
Chief of the Republic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah felt a little dizzy as with carefully assumed
coolness he turned to page five. There, sure enough,
was Sally, looking rather fine drawn in her close-fitting
khaki, but with that half-wicked down-looking
smile upon her that he knew so well. With her
leggings, and her square chin and her &ldquo;bobbed&rdquo; hair
which hung upon her cheeks in side pieces and gave
her a resemblance to Joan of Arc she was like an
exceedingly handsome, but as they say in Blackhamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>ton,
a rather &ldquo;gallus&rdquo; boy. The hussy! He couldn&rsquo;t
help laughing at the picture of her, it was so exactly
how he best remembered her. The amused
slightly defiant You-Be-Damned air was so extraordinarily
like her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blame my cats!&rdquo; said the Mayor.</p>

<p>For several minutes it was his only remark.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XXXVII">XXXVII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE meeting of the Ways and Means Committee
which had been called for a quarter past ten
was of more than local importance. It was of national
importance as the Mayor was careful to inform
its members, among whom were the picked brains
of the community, when he informally opened the
business. But it was not until twenty minutes to
eleven that he was able to do so. It was not that the
Committee itself was unpunctual; it was simply that
one and all had seen that morning&rsquo;s <i>Tribune</i> and that
the common task had perforce to yield for the nonce
to their hearty congratulations.</p>

<p>For one thing, the Mayor had become decidedly
popular; for another, one more glorious page had been
written in history by the Blackhampton born. It was
really surprising the number of absolutely eminent
people who at one time or another had contrived to
be born at Blackhampton. In no city in England did
local patriotism run higher, in no city in England was
there better warrant for it. The Ways and Means
Committee was quite excited. It was almost childishly
delighted at having, as their Chairman, the
rather embarrassed parent of one who, as Sir Reuben
Jope, senior alderman and thrice ex-mayor, said in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>a well turned phrase, &ldquo;bade fair to become the most
famous woman in the Empire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps a certain piquancy was lent to an event
that was already historical, by the knowledge in possession
of those in the inner circle of municipal life
that the Mayor had been hard hit by a former episode
in the dashing career of Miss Sally. That episode
belonged to the pre-war period when the stock of Mr.
Josiah Munt did not stand nearly so high in the market
as it did that morning. More than one of these
seated round the council board with their eyes on the
Chairman had relished the public chastening of the
lord of Strathfieldsaye. He had been smitten in a
tender place and they were not so sorry for him as
they might have been. But other times other modes
of thought. Since July, 1914, water had flowed under
Sharrow Bridge. Nothing could have been more eloquent
of the fact than the rather excited cordiality
of the present gathering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really think, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Sir Reuben Jope,
&ldquo;that the City should recognize Miss Munt&rsquo;s extremely
gallant behavior. I presume, Mr. Town Clerk, it is
competent to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite, sir&mdash;oh, quite.&rdquo; In the expressive words
in which the Mayor reconstructed the scene that evening
for the benefit of the Mayoress, &ldquo;that Aylett
was grinning all over his lantern-jawed mug like a
Barbary ape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall propose at the next meeting of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>Council that a public presentation be made to Miss
Munt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to second that, Sir Reuben,&rdquo; said
Mr. Alderman Limpenny, &ldquo;when the time comes to
do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Mayor interposed with asperity: &ldquo;No,
no, no, gentlemen. We can&rsquo;t have anything of the
kind. Very good of you, I&rsquo;m sure, but we must get
on with the business.&rdquo; His worship rapped smartly
upon the municipal mahogany. &ldquo;This is war time,
remember. We&rsquo;ve got to discuss that contract of Perkins
and Baylis. Seems to me, as I said at the last
meeting, that those jockeys are over-charging the city
forty per cent. You know, gentlemen, we&rsquo;ve got to
stop this leakage of public money. Whatever they
may do in Whitehall, we are not going to stand for
it here. Signing blank checks and dropping them in
Corporation Square is not our form. As long as I
sit in this chair there is going to be strict control of
the public purse. And there is not going to be graft
in this city neither. This is not Westminster. We
don&rsquo;t propose to allow a public department to make a
little mistake in its accounts of a few odd millions sterling
and then jog quietly on as if nothing had occurred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; from the City Treasurer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This war is costing the British people more than
seven millions a day at the present time and to my
mind it&rsquo;s wonderful that they are able to do it at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>price. However, gentlemen, that is by the way. Let
us return to the contract of Perkins and Baylis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Truth to tell the contract of Perkins and Baylis had
less attraction for the Committee at that particular
moment than the picture in the <i>Tribune</i>. Somehow,
the picture had captured its imagination. Whether it
was the leggings, the &ldquo;bobbed&rdquo; hair, the Joan of Arc
profile, or the &ldquo;gallus&rdquo; smile of the undefeated Miss
Sally, it was quite certain that the last had not been
heard of her historic actions.</p>

<p>The Committee of Ways and Means was not alone
in its response to the picture in the <i>Tribune</i> and the
great deeds it commemorated. It was the talk of
the whole city. Josiah moved that day and for many
days in a kind of reflected glory. Wherever he went
congratulations were showered upon him. Three
cheers were given him at the Club when he came in
to lunch. There was a decided tendency to identify
him personally with Sally&rsquo;s fame, which, if exceedingly
gratifying, was in the peculiar circumstances
not a little disconcerting.</p>

<p>For one thing, he was rather at a loss to know what
line he should take in the matter. On the unhappy
occasion of Sally&rsquo;s going to prison he had written her
what he called &ldquo;a very stiff letter.&rdquo; In pretty blunt
language he had told her that as she had disgraced
him in the sight of the world he should have no more
to do with her and that he intended to disinherit her.</p>

<p>To this letter no reply had been received. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>the kind of letter which did not call for one. Since
that time nothing had passed between Sally and himself
on that subject or on any other. But for some
months now Josiah had rather keenly regretted that
his attitude had been so definite. The war seemed to
soften the past and to sharpen the present. In some
respects he was a changed man; one less overbearing
in temper, one less harsh in judgment.</p>

<p>The times had altered. Life itself had altered. He
was not a man to cry over spilt milk, or to deplore
the bygone, but at this moment he had one sharp regret.
Some weeks before Sally had burst into fame
he had made up his mind to restore her to his will
and meant to write and tell her so. But for a man
of his sort the task was hard and he had weakly put
it off from day to day. And now, alas, it was too
late to do it with the grace of the original intention.
It would seem like compulsion now. Josiah was
keenly vexed with himself. Nothing could have been
more eloquent of the rule which hitherto had controlled
his life, &ldquo;Do not put off until to-morrow, etc.&rdquo;
In times like those a cardinal maxim.</p>

<h2 id="XXXVIII">XXXVIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Mayor was in a false position in regard to
his youngest daughter and he had only himself
to blame. But much of his strength lay in the fact
that he was the kind of man whom experience teaches.
Delays, it seemed, were highly dangerous. He must
make up his mind to put his pride in his pocket.</p>

<p>It was not an easy or pleasant operation, but it had
to be performed. Nevertheless, the town had been
ringing a full ten days with the name of Sally before
he could bring himself to turn out after dinner of a
December evening and walk along the road as far as
The Gables.</p>

<p>He was received in the library, as usual, by Lawyer
Mossop. The city&rsquo;s leading solicitor had recently aged
considerably. He looked thinner and grayer, his
cheeks were hollow, there were more lines in his face.
His only son, George, who in the natural course of
events would have carried on a very old established
business, had been killed in France, and news had
lately come that his sister Edith&rsquo;s boy, whom he had
helped to educate and who had already begun to
make his way at the Bar, had been permanently disabled
by the explosion of a hand grenade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>Long training in self-conquest, backed by generations
of emotional restraint, enabled Lawyer Mossop
still to play the man of the world. He rose with a
charming smile and an air of ready courtesy to receive
his distinguished client and neighbor. At a first
glance there was nothing to tell that for the solicitor,
life had lost its savor.</p>

<p>The two men had a long and intimate talk. Oddly
unlike as they were in temperament, education, mental
outlook, their minds had never marched so well
together as this evening in all their years of intercourse.
Somehow the rude vigor, the robust sense of
the client appeared to stimulate the more civilized, the
more finely developed lawyer. Moreover, he could not
fail to perceive that it was a humaner, more liberal-minded
Josiah Munt than he had ever known who had
come to talk with him this evening. Success, popularity,
response to the overwhelming public need had
ripened a remarkable man, rubbed off some of the corners,
softened and harmonized the curious dissonances
that had jarred in what, after all, was a fine character.
Rough diamond as Josiah Munt still was and
must always remain in the eyes of the critical, he
stood out this evening as a right-thinking, straight-seeing
citizen, a real asset to the community.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mossop,&rdquo; he said a little shamefacedly, after their
conversation had gone on some time, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like having
to own up to it, but I&rsquo;m bound to say that I wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>I&rsquo;d had the sense to take that advice you gave me in
the matter of Sally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer could not help a furtive smile at the
humility of the tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to put that gel back in my will.&rdquo; It
was a pretty stiff dose now that it had to be swallowed
and a fierce frown did not conceal its nature. &ldquo;And
I want you to believe, Mossop,&rdquo;&mdash;there was an odd
earnestness in the deep voice&mdash;&ldquo;that I had made up
my mind to do it long before this&mdash;this damnable Serbian
business happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer assured Mr. Munt that he was convinced
of that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serves me right, though, for delaying. Mossop,
I&rsquo;m annoyed with myself. It has the look of a force-put
now, but I as I say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer nodded a nice appreciation of the circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And while I&rsquo;m about it, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to
put Melia, my eldest girl, back as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer gave a little sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My three gels are now going to share alike. But
you must provide six thousand pounds for Gertrude
Preston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer penciled a brief note on his blotting
pad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you know, Mossop, I&rsquo;ve made a goodish bit,
one way and another, since this war began. Those
girls ought to be very well off. And you know, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>course, that we are takin&rsquo; in the next house for my
hospital along The Rise. It&rsquo;ll give us another twenty
beds&mdash;making forty in all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer said in his level voice that he understood
that to be the Mayor&rsquo;s intention when he had
negotiated the purchase with Mr. Harvey Mortimore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We bought that property very well, eh? Not going
to get less in value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m now considering the question of making it
over permanently to the Corporation. Wouldn&rsquo;t make
a bad nest egg for the city, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very generous gift, Mr. Munt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I&rsquo;m arranging with the Duke to come
over on the twenty-sixth of January to open the new
annex. And in the meantime we&rsquo;ll think about giving
it to the city as an orphanage or a cottage hospital.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="XXXIX">XXXIX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE next morning Josiah paid a visit to Love
Lane. The business of Sally had taught him
a lesson. Events moved so quickly in these crowded
days that it might not be wise to postpone a reconciliation
with Melia.</p>

<p>So busy had the Mayor been since his return from
Bridlington at the end of August that he had not
found time to visit his eldest daughter, nor had she
been to Strathfieldsaye since her first somewhat uncomfortable
appearance there. She was still inclined
to be much on her dignity. Women who lead lonely
lives in oppressive surroundings are not easily able
to forget the past. The olive branch had been offered
already; but it was by no means certain that Melia
intended to accept her father&rsquo;s overtures.</p>

<p>This December morning, however, as the great
man, proceeding majestically on foot from the Duke
of Wellington, turned up the narrow street with its
worn cobblestones and its double row of mean little
houses, he fully intended as far as might be humanly
possible &ldquo;to right things with Melia once for all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor entered the shop and found his eldest
daughter serving a woman in a white apron and a
black and white checked shawl over her head with two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>pennyworth of carrots and a stick of celery. The
honest dame was so taken aback by the arrival of the
Mayor of the city, who was personally known to every
man, woman and child throughout the district as one
of a great triumvirate, of whom the King and the
Prime Minister were the other two, that she fled in
hot haste without paying for the spoils she bore away
in her apron.</p>

<p>Melia, however, true to the stock whence she sprang,
had no false delicacy in the matter. Without taking
the slightest notice of the august visitor, she was the
other side the counter in a jiffy, out of the shop and
calling after the fleeing customer, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t paid
your fivepence, Mrs. Odell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor stood at the shop door, watching with
a kind of grim enjoyment the process of the fivepence
being extracted. He plainly approved it. Melia, with
all her limitations, had the root of the matter in her.
Upon her return, a little flushed and rather breathless,
he refrained from paying her the compliment he
felt she deserved but was content to ask if trade was
brisk.</p>

<p>Trade was brisker, said Melia, than she had ever
known it.</p>

<p>Josiah was glad of that. He then looked round to
assure himself that they were alone in the shop and
being convinced that such was the case, he stood a
moment awkwardly silent, balancing himself like a
stork first on one leg and then on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gel,&rdquo; he took her hand suddenly, &ldquo;you are back in
my will. Sally&rsquo;s back too. You are both going to
have an equal share with Ethel.&rdquo; He felt the roughened,
toil-stained hand begin to quiver a little in his
strong grasp. &ldquo;Bygones have got to be bygones. Understand
me.&rdquo; He drew her towards him and kissed
her stoutly and firmly in the middle of the forehead.</p>

<p>He retained his hold while her hot tears dripped
on to his hand. She stood tense and rigid, unable to
speak or move. But she knew as she stood there that
it was no use fighting him or fighting herself. His
masterfulness, his simplicity, his courage had reawakened
her earliest and deepest instinct, the love and
admiration she had once had for him. Of a sudden
she began to sob pitifully. With a queer look on his
face he took out a large red handkerchief and put
his arms round her and wiped her eyes slowly and
with a gentleness hard to credit in him, just as he had
done when as a very little girl she had fallen and hurt
herself on the tiled yard of the Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>Speech was not possible to father or daughter for
several minutes as time is reckoned in Love Lane,
although to both it seemed infinitely longer, and then
said the Mayor, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll expect you up at Strathfieldsaye
on Christmas Day. Lunch one-thirty sharp.&rdquo;
Then he added in a tone that was almost peremptory,
&ldquo;If that man o&rsquo; yours happens to get home on leave
your mother would like him to come, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her tear-dimmed eyes looked at him rather queerly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know, Dad?&rdquo; The voice had something
in it of the child he remembered but it was so faint
that it was barely audible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; His own voice had more asperity
than it was meant to have. But she was able to make
allowances for it, as she always had done in the days
when she really understood him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bill&rsquo;s in hospital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew in his breath quickly. The thought ran
through his mind that it was well he had had the sense
to learn by experience. &ldquo;Where? What hospital?&rdquo;
He was just a trifle nervous, just a shade flurried.
As near as a toucher he had put it off too long, as in
the case of Sally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In France. At the Base.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says it&rsquo;s only a cushy ... but ... but somehow
I don&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean you don&rsquo;t trust him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean this, Dad.&rdquo; She was quite composed now;
the tears and the shakings were under control; she
spoke slowly and calmly. &ldquo;No matter how bad he
was, he&rsquo;s not one as would ever let on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be afraid it might upset you. He&rsquo;s got like
that lately.&rdquo; Suddenly the hard eyes filled again. &ldquo;He
grins and bears things now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>Josiah nodded rather grimly, but made no comment.
He turned on his heel. &ldquo;See you this day fortnight
up at the house.&rdquo; Abruptly, in deep thought, he went
away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XL">XL</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ILL&rsquo;S wound, as it turned out, was a painful one,
and it had an element of danger. His right leg
was shattered, also poisoned badly; it would take a
long time to heal and there was a fear that amputation
might be necessary. Such a case demanded special
treatment, and to Melia&rsquo;s joy at the beginning of
Christmas week she received word from her father
that her husband had been transferred from France
to the Mayor of Blackhampton&rsquo;s hospital.</p>

<p>There is no saying how this providential arrangement
came about. It may have been coincidence; on
the other hand it may not. Josiah in his second year
of office was certainly becoming a power, if not an
actual puller of strings. Influence may or may not
have been at work; anyhow the Corporal bore the
long journey so well that Melia, as a special concession,
was allowed to see him for a short time on
Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>She found him wonderfully cheerful in spite of the
fact that he had endured much pain; more cheerful
perhaps than she had ever known him. A subtle
change had taken place since she had seen him last.
The look of utter weariness had yielded to something
else. It was as if he had been spiritualized by suffering;
indeed as he smiled at her gently from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>bed she felt that he was not the kind of man she used
to know.</p>

<p>The memory of those few exquisite days in the summer
was still in their minds. It was from that point
they now took up their lives. For both the world
had changed. They saw each other with new eyes.
This man of hers had been as good as his word, he
had done his best to come back to her; and there, full
of pain, he lay helpless as a baby, yet now inexpressibly
dear as the only thing in life that had any meaning
for her. As for himself, as he smiled up at her,
the grace of his dreams was again upon her. This
was she about whom the romance of his youth had
been woven. He didn&rsquo;t see her as she was, a commonplace,
worn, gray-haired woman, or if he did he
remembered the sacrifices she had made for his sake;
he remembered that she had once believed in him, and
after long days she had come to believe in him again.</p>

<p>There was rare conflict in the clean and quiet room.
The walls were hung with holly; everything about
the place seemed to minister to a wonderful sense of
home. He sighed a deep content as she took a chair
by his bed and held a feverish hand in hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s hospital!&rdquo; A deep sigh spoke of
gratitude. &ldquo;When you happen to see him tell him
from me I&rsquo;m glad to be in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She promised to do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good place.&rdquo; His eyes and his voice grew
softer than their wont in speaking of his father-in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>-law.
&ldquo;A bit of luck to be here.&rdquo; He sighed luxuriously.</p>

<p>Said Melia, &ldquo;You must take your time getting well,
Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eyes of suffering looked into hers. &ldquo;I expect I
won&rsquo;t be right just yet.&rdquo; They were still together,
passing the time with delightful fragments of talk
and with fragments of silence equally delightful when
a nurse came importantly into the room to say that
the Mayor had arrived unexpectedly to look round
the hospital and to wish a happy Christmas to his
guests.</p>

<p>Melia rose rather nervously. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be going,
Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, my dear.&rdquo; The voice from the bed was
calm and quiet. &ldquo;We must let bygones be bygones.
The times has changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was glad to hear him say that. And she had
not told him yet of her father&rsquo;s recent act of reparation.
Should she tell him now? Was the moment
favorable? Or had she better wait until&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The question, however, was already decided. Too
late to tell him now. The door at the other end of
the room was open and the Commandant had entered
followed by his worship the Mayor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one bed in this room, sir,&rdquo; said the Commandant.
&ldquo;A special case. Corporal Hollis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor looked calmly round. He didn&rsquo;t see
Melia who was hidden by a screen between the bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>stead
and the door. &ldquo;I notice, ma&rsquo;am, you&rsquo;ve got another
door yonder.&rdquo; He pointed to the other end of
the room. &ldquo;Hope these new casements fit well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new casements fitted very well indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo;&mdash;the deep voice was very much
that of the man of affairs&mdash;&ldquo;I expect you get a bit
of draught here when the wind blows from the northeast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The draught was nothing to speak of, he was assured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any complaints? Heating apparatus all right?
Ventilators working properly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were no complaints to make of any kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the Mayor. &ldquo;You can
leave me here alone a few minutes with Corporal
Hollis&mdash;if he&rsquo;s well enough to talk to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Commandant retired, closing the door after
her, and the Mayor slowly approached the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, Bill?&rdquo; It was a tone of simple,
hearty kindness.</p>

<p>Before the occupant of the bed could answer the
question, Josiah, coming round the corner of the
screen, was taken aback by the sight of his eldest
daughter. He was not prepared for her, yet he was
quite equal to the situation. &ldquo;Hulloa, Melia&rdquo;&mdash;it
was a father&rsquo;s cordiality. &ldquo;How are you, gel? Happy
Christmas to you. Happy Christmas to you both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a little while he stood talking to them, easily
and without constraint, while the Corporal lay in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>bed saying nothing, but with his worn face softened
by pain and service and the thought of others. From
time to time he smiled grayly at the Mayor&rsquo;s pungent
humor. Even in the old days &ldquo;the Mester&rdquo; had always
had a liberal share of that quality in which his
fellow townsmen excelled. Josiah&rsquo;s sense of humor
was very keen, particularly when it came to assessing
the shortcomings of other people; it had a breadth,
a gusto, a penetration which high office seemed to amplify.
His stories, comments, criticisms of those prominently
before the world kept the Corporal quietly
amused for some time. Finally, the Mayor looked at
his watch. &ldquo;I must be getting on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
to address the War Workers&rsquo; Association at six
o&rsquo;clock. And at seven I&rsquo;ve promised to look in at
the Hearts of Oak annual soiree and concert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very simply and with the manliness that was part
of him he held out his hand. Without hesitation the
Corporal took it. They looked in the eyes of one
another. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re quite comfortable,&rdquo; said Josiah.
&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything you need you have only
to let me know. So long, my boy, and don&rsquo;t be in
a hurry to get well. See you to-morrow, Melia. Wish
you could have brought Bill along with you. Happy
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a wave of the hand for them both the Mayor
went away, exuding an atmosphere of kindness and
goodwill towards all men except Germans. In the
Mayor&rsquo;s opinion Germans were not men at all.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XLI">XLI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T would have been ungracious of Melia not to
spend Christmas Day at Strathfieldsaye. Indeed,
she felt that she could hardly do otherwise. That
stubborn thing, pride, might still be lurking in the
corners of her heart, yet it durst not show itself openly;
besides, whatever its secret machinations, she could
not overlook the fact that her father was striving
to wipe out the past. Perhaps the past is the only
thing easier to create than to destroy, but certainly
Josiah was now trying his best to undo it. And this
Melia knew.</p>

<p>In view of the important function on Christmas
Day, Melia had been taken in hand by Aunt Gerty.
It would have been natural to resent the interference
of that lady, but it was clear that her actions were
inspired &ldquo;from above.&rdquo; At the same time no emissary
could have been more tactful, more discreet. In situations
that called for finesse she was hard to beat;
and she was able to have Melia &ldquo;fitted&rdquo; for a <i>really</i>
good coat and skirt by her own accomplished dressmaker,
Miss Pratt, and helped her also to choose a
hat at Messrs. Rostron and Merton&rsquo;s, the best shop in
the city, without arousing antagonism in that sensitive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>soul. Also she whispered in Melia&rsquo;s ear that there
was reason to believe that her father had a little surprise
in store for her on Christmas Day.</p>

<p>In regard to &ldquo;the surprise&rdquo; Gerty&rsquo;s information was
correct. And as Melia, looking and feeling far more
fashionable than she had ever done in her life, turned
up at Strathfieldsaye at a quarter past one, &ldquo;the surprise&rdquo;
duly materialized even before the Christmas
luncheon at one-thirty. Her father gave her a check
for fifty pounds.</p>

<p>On Melia&rsquo;s last visit to Strathfieldsaye she had felt
quite &ldquo;out of it,&rdquo; but not so now. Partly it may have
been the new clothes. Formerly, she had felt self-conscious,
awkward, hopelessly shabby in the midst
of a grandeur to which she was unused, whereby she
was thrown back upon her embittered self, but now
her changing circumstances, the considered kindness
of her mother and Gerty, and especially her father&rsquo;s
new attitude towards her gave her a sense of happiness
almost.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fact that Ethel, Mrs. Doctor Cockburn,
was unable to be present may also have ministered a
little to this feeling. Ethel&rsquo;s absence was much deplored.
Somehow a void was created which seemed
to rob the modest function of any claim to distinction
it might have had; yet in her heart Melia felt that
the absence of Mrs. Doctor made it easier for her
personally, and even for her mother, whatever it may
have done for people so accomplished in the world as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>her father now was, and for Aunt Gerty who somehow
had learned to be genteel without being stuck-up.
With Ethel, on the other hand, she had never
felt quite at her ease. Nor did anybody, if it came
to that. Putting people at their ease was not among
Mrs. Doctor Cockburn&rsquo;s many gifts. She was so
much a lady that simple folk were apt to be overwhelmed
by her sense of her happy condition. It was
difficult for ordinary people to be their plain selves
in her presence; ordinary they might be, but in social
intercourse Mrs. Doctor seemed almost to resent their
plainness as being in the nature of a slight upon herself.</p>

<p>However, Ethel was not there. And in Melia&rsquo;s
opinion her absence gave a finer flavor to the turkey,
a gentler quality to the plum pudding and a more
subtle aroma to the blazing fumes that crowned it.
Nevertheless, it was a theme for much comment. An
Event of the first magnitude was almost due to take
place in the family; and the head of it, presiding over
the modest feast with a kind of genial majesty which
ever-growing public recognition of his unusual qualities
seemed to enhance and to humanize, made no secret
of the fact that he very much wanted to have a
little grandson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Josiah,&rdquo; said the gallant Gerty, adding a little
water to some excellent claret and smiling at him
with two level rows of white teeth, &ldquo;I am sure we
all hope your wish will be gratified. No man, I&rsquo;m
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>sure, if I may be allowed to say so, more thoroughly
deserves a little grandson than yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To some minds, perhaps, it was not quite in the
Gertrude tradition. It was Christmas Day and in
crowning the Christmas pudding Josiah had been a
thought on the free side, no doubt, with some of the
finest old brandy even the Duke of Wellington could
boast; but in any case she meant well. All the same,
the Mayoress could not repress a slight frown of annoyance.
The demonstration did not amount to more
than that. It did not really convict Gerty of bad
taste, but Maria felt somehow that she had to watch
her continually. Gerty was such a Schemer. Besides,
what business was it of Gerty&rsquo;s anyway?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Gert.&rdquo; The Mayor raised his glass
to the Serpent with the homely charm that was never
seen to greater advantage than on Christmas Day in
the family circle. &ldquo;Good health and good luck all
round. I must have that little grandson, somehow.
Melia, my gel, that&rsquo;s something for you and your good
man to bear in mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia flushed. She looked so confused and so unhappy
that the watchful Gerty, who with all her ways
really spent a good deal of time thinking for others,
suddenly perceived that it might be kind to change
the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Josiah,&rdquo; said Gerty, &ldquo;what is this one hears about
a public presentation to Sally?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well ask that.&rdquo; The Mayor held up a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>glass of &rsquo;68 port to the light. &ldquo;Some of those jockeys
on the City Council have been making themselves very
officious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it, Josiah.&rdquo; Gerty was just as pat
as your hat. &ldquo;Think of the honor she&rsquo;s brought to
the city. Surely right and surely proper that what
Sally has done should be publicly recognized. Even
the <i>Times</i> says she&rsquo;s a credit to the Empire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All very well,&rdquo; said his worship. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s nothing
like ten years since I used to lay her across my
knee and spank her. There was one slipper I kept
for the purpose.&rdquo; With a humorous sigh he converged
upon the brim of his wine glass. &ldquo;But I could
never make nothing of that gel. There was always
the devil in her. Public presentation&rsquo;s all very well,
but some of those jockeys on the Council have persuaded
the Duke to make it, and he&rsquo;s fair set on my
takin&rsquo; the chair as I&rsquo;m Mayor o&rsquo; the city and so on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Duke is such a sensible man!&rdquo; An arch preen
of Gerty&rsquo;s plumage. &ldquo;Only right and proper, Josiah,
that you should take the chair. The other day,
according to the <i>Tribune</i>, the French Government gave
her a very high decoration. She&rsquo;s quite a heroine in
Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised at anything.&rdquo; In the Mayor&rsquo;s
grim eye was quite as much vexation as there was
humor. &ldquo;Stubborn as a mule. And that independent.
Must always go her own gait. Nice thing my
having to preside over three thousand people while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>she&rsquo;s being handed an illuminated address. Of course,
that Aylett&rsquo;s at the back of it. Mischievous dog! I
said if there must be a public presentation, as I was
the father o&rsquo; the hussy, it was up to somebody else
to preside. But, seemingly, they don&rsquo;t take to the
idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Josiah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Groaned the Mayor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to make the best of
it, I suppose. Still, a scurvy trick on the part of
that Aylett.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="XLII">XLII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N spite of the Mayor&rsquo;s attitude, which was unsympathetic
to the verge of discouragement, the Town
Clerk was able to inform him on New Year&rsquo;s morning
that Miss Sarah Ann Munt had graciously consented
to accept an illuminated address in commemoration
of her deeds on January twenty-fifth at the
Floral Hall. The news was not received graciously.
Josiah had comforted himself with the not unreasonable
hope that the Hussy would decline the presentation;
it would be so like her to upset their plans.
But no, after all, Sally preferred to behave with still
deeper cussedness. She wrote a charmingly polite
letter from the Depôt of the Northern Command at
Screwton, where she was at present attached, to inform
the members of the Blackhampton City Council
that it would give her great pleasure to attend the
function on January twenty-fifth and that she was
very sensible of the honor about to be conferred upon
her. And that, after all, was even more like her than
a refusal of the proposal would have been.</p>

<p>Josiah was more disconcerted than he cared to own.
It was necessary to hide his feelings as far as he could,
but he was not a finished dissembler, and, in addition
to &ldquo;that Aylett,&rdquo; there were several members of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>Council who seemed to enjoy the situation. Several
of these received a piece of the Mayor&rsquo;s mind in the
course of the morning. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know what they
could be thinking of to be wastin&rsquo; the Town&rsquo;s money
in that way.&rdquo; In other words, Josiah had decided to
carry things off with a high hand.</p>

<p>That evening, after dinner, he sat down and wrote
a letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;Dear Sarah Ann, I understand that you are to be presented
with an Address on the twenty-fifth at the Floral
Hall. Your mother and I hope that you will be able to come
and stay here over the week end. Your affectionate Father,
Josiah Munt. P.S. No need to tell you that this Affair is
none of my doing.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It was not an easy letter to write nor was the Mayor
altogether satisfied when it was written. But in the
circumstances it wouldn&rsquo;t do to say too much.</p>

<p>By return of post came a dry, rather curt note from
Sally. She thanked her father for the invitation,
but she had already promised Ethel that when next
in Blackhampton she would stay at Park Crescent.</p>

<p>Josiah felt annoyed. Once more it was so like her.
Somehow the reply left him less easy in his mind
than ever. He would be glad when the ordeal of the
twenty-fifth was over. He didn&rsquo;t trust the minx. As
likely as not she would play some trick or other; she
was quite capable of affronting him publicly. However,
the eyes of the world were upon him, he must
keep a stiff upper lip, he must see that she didn&rsquo;t
down him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, from another quarter, bitter disappointment
came. The high hopes of a little grandson
did not materialize. Instead of a lusty Horace Josiah
Cockburn bursting upon a flattered world, the inferior
tribe of Gwenneths and Gwladyses had a Gwendolen
added to their number. It was quite a blow. The
Mayor and all his family had set their hearts on a boy.
For once the successful Ethel had been less than
herself. She had failed conspicuously. It was impossible
to conceal the fact that people were a little
disappointed with her.</p>

<p>Happily, Gwendolen had enough sense of proportion
and right feeling to arrive according to schedule.
It would have been unpardonable in her to have prevented
Mrs. Doctor from attending the important
function on the twenty-fifth at the Floral Hall and
the even more important ceremony on the twenty-sixth
when the Duke was to open the new annex to
the Mayor of Blackhampton&rsquo;s hospital, which at one
acute moment she had threatened to do. Fortunately
Gwendolen remembered herself in time. She contrived
to make her appearance on January second in
this vale of tears, and, although from the outset not
a popular member of society, after all she was less
unpopular than she might have been had she deferred
her arrival until a week later.</p>

<h2 id="XLIII">XLIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE scene at the Floral Hall was worthy of the
occasion. All that was best in the public life
of Blackhampton and of the county of Middleshire
was gathered in force in the ornate building in New
Square.</p>

<p>There was more than one reason for the representative
character of the audience. In the first place it
was felt to be a royal opportunity to exalt the horn
of patriotism. This public recognition of the heroic
Miss Munt was a compliment paid to the women of
Britain, to those many thousands of magnificent women
whose deeds had proved them worthy of their
brothers, their husbands and their sons. Again, the
figure of Sally herself had fired the public imagination.
A Joan of Arc profile overlaid by a general air of
you-be-damnedness made an ideal picture postcard
as her father had already found to his cost. All sorts
of people seemed to take a fantastic pleasure in addressing
them to Josiah Munt, Esquire, J.P., Strathfieldsaye,
The Rise, Blackhampton. &ldquo;How proud you
must be of her,&rdquo; et cetera. Ad nauseam.</p>

<p>Moreover, this function was intended as a tribute
to the Mayor himself. His worth was now recognized
by all classes. He was the right man in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>right place; his boundless energy and his practical
sense were of the utmost value to the community;
and the wise men of that thickly populated district
seized the chance of paying homage to Josiah and at
the same time of exploiting a powerful personality in
the interests of the state.</p>

<p>At three o&rsquo;clock, when the Mayor came on to the
platform, the large hall was very full. He was followed
by the Duke of Dumbarton, a genial, young-middle-aged
nobleman, who was to make the presentation,
and by other magnates. Behind the Chairman
many notables were seated already; and to lend point
to the somewhat intimate nature of the proceedings,
which may or may not have been part of the design
of these &ldquo;in the know,&rdquo; the members of Josiah&rsquo;s family
with the national heroine in their midst had been
grouped prominently upon his right hand.</p>

<p>The Town Clerk, a little wickedly perhaps, had
intimated beforehand to the Mayor that the proceedings
would really be in the nature of &ldquo;a family party.&rdquo;
At all events, his worship took the hint &ldquo;of that Aylett&rdquo;
literally. Before sitting down at the table and
taking formal charge of the meeting his eyes chanced
to light on a group of men in hospital blue for whom
places had been reserved in the front row of the balcony.
Among these he recognized Corporal Hollis,
whose leg as a result of five weeks&rsquo; special treatment
had improved quite remarkably.</p>

<p>The Mayor went to the end of the platform and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>called loudly, &ldquo;Bill, you are wanted down here. Come
on to the platform, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal did not covet notoriety, but it would
have been as wise to thwart the waters of Niagara as
to resist the will of the City&rsquo;s chief magistrate at a
public meeting. Until his instructions had been carried
out there was not a chance of a start being made.
Reluctantly realizing this the Corporal in the course
of three minutes had made his way down from the
gallery and on to the platform, a crutch in each hand,
where his august father-in-law received him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Bill.&rdquo; He was shepherded along the
front row of chairs as if the presence of three thousand
people was a very ordinary matter. &ldquo;You come
and sit with the wife. Colonel Hickman, kindly move
up a bit. Thank you. Like a chair for your leg?
If you do, I&rsquo;ll get one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal declined a chair for his leg, just as
the meeting incited by certain officious members of
the Town Council broke into cheers. Melia and the
Corporal, seated side by side, were covered in momentary
confusion. Then the chairman took his seat
at the table, reduced the meeting to silence by rapping
the board sternly with his mallet and stood up
again briefly to open the proceedings. These consisted
in patriotic speeches from Lieutenant-General Sir
William Hardcastle, K.C.B., and the Duke of Dumbarton,
and the presentation of an illuminated scroll
in a gold casket to Miss Sarah Ann Munt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>First, a speech excellent in its kind, which paid
tribute to the deeds of the sons and daughters of the
Empire in all parts of the world; also it emphasized
the sternness of the hour and the need for &ldquo;keeping
on, keeping on.&rdquo; Then, amid a flutter of excitement,
came the presentation to Miss Munt. It was made by
the Duke, a figure deservedly popular all over the
district from which, to be sure, he derived immense
revenues. A master of courtly phrase and well turned
compliment, he gave the heroine of the occasion the
full benefit of his powers. And when at last, in the
purview of three thousand people, the dauntless Sally
came forth to the table to receive the casket and scroll
she was a sight to behold.</p>

<p>Rather tall, very slender, brown of cheek and with
the eye of a falcon, in her simple, faded, but much beribboned
khaki she looked at that moment a child of
the gods. At the sight of her a thrill ran through
the hall. Cinema, newspaper, picture postcard had
led that assembly to set its hopes high, but the reality,
in its calm strength, with a faintly ironical smile
fusing a noble fixity of purpose, more than fulfilled
them. In the youngest daughter of the Mayor of the
city was symbolized the glorious spirit of the youth of
the Empire.</p>

<p>A hush came over the great audience. The Duke
opened the casket and took out the scroll. Everybody
seemed fascinated by her, including the members of
her own family in a group at the right-hand of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>Chair. But there was just one person there who did
not seem willing to submit without a struggle to her
dynamic influence; and that person was her rather
rueful, slightly scandalized male parent.</p>

<p>Even now, in this, of all moments, his worship
seemed to detect in that amazing personality the spirit
of Damnable Independence. How many times in the
past, in the stress of combat, when it had been his will
against hers, had he seen that dogged, oh-go-to-the-devil
look which would surely have driven him mad
had not he been weak enough to admire it secretly.
There was no getting topside of a look of that kind.
As she stood in the presence of the ducal necktie,
with a faint trace of humorous scorn at the corners
of her lips, the outraged Chairman suddenly caught
and fixed her eye. And as he did so his own eye, as
of old, seemed to say to her, &ldquo;One word from You,
our Sally, and I&rsquo;ll give You such a Lammoxing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The casket and scroll were handed to Miss Munt,
who acknowledged them with a graceful inclination
of an imperial head, and then cheers broke out in a
hurricane. In part, no doubt, they were inspired by
family associations, for her father had grown vastly
popular; but in large measure they were due beyond
a doubt to sheer power of personality. The secret
force which distinguishes one human being from another,
over and beyond their works and their walk
in life, belonged to Sally in sovereign degree. Her
portraits and her fame had kindled hopes which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>dauntless reality had more than fulfilled. In the sight
of all she stood a true daughter of her race, foursquare,
unconquerable.</p>

<p>At last the cheers subsided and then arose demands
for a speech from the Mayor. As the result of assiduous
practice in war oratory Josiah had won remarkable
success. He did not pretend to polish or
to flights of intellect or fancy, but he had a knack
of speechmaking that was immensely to the taste of
his fellow citizens. In response to the insistent demand
of the meeting he rose ponderously.</p>

<p>On the crowded platform, as in the body of the
hall itself, was many a shrewd judge of men. The
average Briton of all classes has an instinct in such
matters that is almost uncanny. He knows a man
when he sees one. And when the Mayor stood up
to address them, a little yet not too much, embarrassed
by the nature of his reception, all present knew
that they saw one now. Charmed and delighted by
the heroine of the piece, so shrewd a body of persons
may also have been rather amazed that she had come
to happen. But, somehow, her father seemed to explain
her. A rough diamond, no doubt, but at that
moment, in his self-possession, in his self-belief, in
his titanic grappling power when faced with difficulty,
he was an expression of the genius of the race.</p>

<p>All the same it was not easy for the Mayor of
Blackhampton to find words at that moment. As a
rule, when on his legs he did not suffer a lack of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>He had a natural gift of speech and a faculty of humor
which found expression in many a racy idiom.
But his powers threatened to desert him now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he began. There was a
pause and then he began again. &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen.&rdquo;
There was a second pause while three thousand
sympathetic fellow citizens hung upon the
phrase. And then at last slowly and grimly the great
voice boomed out, &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, there are
those who think they can down the Anglo-Saxon race,
but&rdquo;&mdash;slight pause&mdash;&ldquo;they don&rsquo;t know what they are
un-der-ta-kin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was one pause more. It lasted but an instant
for the meeting broke out in a roar. Only too
well had the Mayor interpreted the thought that was
dominating the minds of his fellow citizens.</p>

<h2 id="XLIV">XLIV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">O</span>N the Sunday after the famous meeting at the
Floral Hall, Bill paid a first visit to Strathfieldsaye.
He was loth to yield to the will of his
father-in-law, but Josiah would take no denial. Corporal
Hollis was a stubborn man, but no one under
the rank of a field marshal could hope to resist effectively
the Mayor of Blackhampton in his second
year of office.</p>

<p>Due notice was given by Josiah that he was going
personally to fetch Melia on Sunday afternoon. He intended
to drive in his car to Love Lane for that purpose.
On the way back he would call at the hospital
for the Corporal &ldquo;who must come along up home and
drink a dish of tea with Maria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The program was not exactly to the taste of Bill,
who had little use for tea and perhaps even less use
for his &ldquo;in-laws.&rdquo; But what could he do in face of
the Mayor&rsquo;s ukase?</p>

<p>Thus it was that in the twilight of a memorable
Sunday the Corporal made his first appearance in
Strathfieldsaye&rsquo;s spacious drawing-room. In the past
month his leg had surprisingly improved, but final recovery
would be long and slow, and he still required
two crutches. On entering the room he was a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>disconcerted to find so distinguished a company, for
in addition to the Mayoress, mutely superb at the tea
table, was Mrs. Doctor Cockburn, more vocal in black
velvet, Miss Preston, as usual, touched with fashion,
and, standing on the hearthrug, near the fire, in her
faded khaki was the slight but martial form of Sally.</p>

<p>The presence of Sally was a surprise to the Mayor.
He had not expected to see her there, and as soon as
his eye lit on her he gave a start. First of all, however,
he shepherded the Corporal into a comfortable
chair with a tenderness hard to credit in him, fixing
up the injured leg on a second chair and laying the
crutches on the carpet by the Corporal&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>Having done all this, the Mayor moved up to the
hearthrug, his hand outstretched. &ldquo;Very glad to see
you here, my gel.&rdquo; Without hesitation and in the
frankest way he kissed Sally loudly upon the cheek.
It was manly and it was also bold, for such an act
seemed perilously like kissing in public a decidedly soldierlike
young man.</p>

<p>Sally didn&rsquo;t seem to mind, however. She was just
as frank and unaffected as her father. Moreover,
she had acquired a rich laugh and an authority of
manner almost the equal of his own. She complimented
him upon his speech and quizzically added
that he ought to stand for Parliament. Josiah
promptly rejoined that if he did he&rsquo;d be as much use
as some of those jackasses, no doubt.</p>

<p>The Mayor then carried a cup of tea to the Corporal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>and Aunt Gerty provided him with bread and butter
and a plate to put it on; and then Sally moved across
from the chimneypiece, sat down very simply on a
hassock by his side and began at once to talk to him.
Plain, direct talk it was, full of technical turns and
queer out-of-the-way information which could have
only come from the most intimate first-hand knowledge.
But it was palpably unstudied, without the least
wish to pose or impress, and presently with almost
the same air of blunt modesty the Corporal began
talking to her.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Doctor and even to Miss Preston it seemed
rather odd that a real live graduate of Heaven-knew-where
should sit tête-à-tête with poor Melia&rsquo;s husband
and be completely absorbed by him and the crude halting
syllables he emitted from time to time. Still to
the Mayor himself, standing with his broad back to
the fire and toying like a large but domesticated wolf
with a buttered scone, it didn&rsquo;t seem so remarkable.</p>

<p>Josiah, at any rate, was able to perceive that his
youngest daughter and his son-in-law were occupied
with realities. They had been through the fire. Battle,
murder, death in every unspeakable form had been
their companions months on end. These two were full-fledged
Initiates in an exclusive Order.</p>

<p>The Mayor, foursquare on the hearthrug, had
never seemed more at home in the family circle, but,
even his noble self-assurance abated a feather or two
out of deference to Sally and the Corporal. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>had been there. They knew. If Josiah had respect
for anything it was for actual first-hand experience.</p>

<p>Mrs. Doctor, however, was not fettered by the vanities
of hero worship. In spite of Sally and in spite
of the Corporal she was able as usual to bring her
light tea table artillery into play. At strategic intervals
her high-pitched, authoritative voice took spasmodic
charge of the proceedings. Now it was the
Egg Fund and the incompetence of Lady Jope, now
the latest dicta of Miss Heber-Knollys, now the widespread
complaints of the Duke&rsquo;s inaudibility at the
Floral Hall.</p>

<p>Miss Preston fully agreed. &ldquo;So different from you,
Josiah.&rdquo; She was well on the target as usual. &ldquo;But
he made up for it, didn&rsquo;t he, by the nice things he
said of you when he opened the Annex?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very flattering, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Mrs. Doctor took up
the ball. &ldquo;And wasn&rsquo;t it charming of him to come
here to lunch. Such an unaffected man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah broke his scone in half and held a piece in
each hand. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he come here?&rdquo; The
voice had the old huffiness, yet mitigated now by an
undeniable twinkle of humor. &ldquo;He got quite as good
food here as he&rsquo;d get at home, even if we don&rsquo;t run
to gold plate and flunkeys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite, Josiah, quite,&rdquo; piped the undefeated Gerty.
&ldquo;And only too glad, I&rsquo;m sure, to come and see the
Mayor of Blackhampton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laugh of his worship verged upon the whim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>sical.
&ldquo;Gert, if you want my private opinion, he
didn&rsquo;t come to see me at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, then, Father, who did he come to see?&rdquo;
fluted Mrs. Doctor.</p>

<p>Josiah jerked a humorous thumb in the direction
of Sally, who was still tête-à-tête with the Corporal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s my opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was hard for Mrs. Doctor to believe that her
youngest sister could be the attraction. But her father
was clear upon the point. And that being the case
it made the pity all the greater that Sally had declined
the invitation to be present. She had been urged to
come to luncheon and meet the Duke who was anxious
to meet her, but she had preferred to stay at
Park Crescent and play with the children.</p>

<p>So like her!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XLV">XLV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;D</span>&rsquo;YOU mind if I smoke, Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady at the tea table looked mutely at
her lord.</p>

<p>Josiah nodded graciously. &ldquo;Do as you like, gel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally produced a wisp of paper and a very masculine
tobacco pouch and began rolling a cigarette in an
extremely competent manner. Josiah proffered a box
of Egyptian but Sally preferred her own and struck
a match on the sole of her shoe in a fashion at once
so accomplished and so boylike as to take away the
breath of her mother and Aunt Gerty.</p>

<p>As she sat talking easily and yet gravely to the
Corporal with her long straight legs and trim ankles
freely displayed by a surprisingly short khaki skirt
she looked more like a boy than ever. And such was
the thought in the minds of the other three ladies, who
agreed tacitly that the skirt and the cigarette and the
astonishing freedom of pose were not quite maidenly.
Still with those ribbons, and that clear deep voice and
that wonderful eye she was fascinating. Even her
father, who on principle declined to admire her
Damnable Independence, was unable to resist the impact
of a personality that was now world famous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Gazing at her in stern astonishment he pointed to
her abbreviated lower garment. &ldquo;Excuse me, gel,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but do you mind telling us what you&rsquo;ve got
underneath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally deigned no reply in words, but stuck the cigarette
in the corner of her mouth with unconscious grace
and dexterously lifted her skirt. A decidedly workmanlike
pair of knickerbockers was disclosed.</p>

<p>Josiah gasped.</p>

<p>The unconcerned Sally continued to talk with the
Corporal, while the Mayor, half scandalized, struggled
against a guffaw. &ldquo;Things seem to be changing
a bit, as you might say. Don&rsquo;t you think so,
Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Gerty took upon herself to answer, as she
often did, for poor bewildered Maria. &ldquo;I fully agree,
Josiah.&rdquo; She lowered her discreet voice. &ldquo;But almost
a pity ... almost a pity ... don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor pursed his lips. &ldquo;Durned if I know
what to think, Gert.&rdquo; He scratched a dubious head.
&ldquo;Seems to me the Empire is not going to be short o&rsquo;
man power for some little time to come, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still ... not ... quite ... maidenly ... Josiah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daresay you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; The Mayor fought down
his feelings. &ldquo;Next chicken on the roost&rsquo;ll be the
hussy puttin&rsquo; up for parliament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bound to get in if she does,&rdquo; Gerty sounded rather
rueful. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a constituency in England that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>wouldn&rsquo;t jump at the chance of electing her just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah breathed hard while this obvious truth sank
into his bones, but Mrs. Doctor assured Gerty that
she was talking nonsense. Her father being frankly
opposed to this pious opinion, Ethel appealed to her
mother. Maria, alas, was in the position of a modest
wether who has given birth to a superb young
panther. She simply didn&rsquo;t know what to think, and
by forlornly folding her hands on her lap gave mute
expression to her feelings.</p>

<p>At the best, however, it was a futile discussion as
Gerty was quick to realize. She turned the talk
adroitly into other channels. &ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;as I was walking along Queen&rsquo;s Road I had
quite a shock. I met a blind man being led by an old
woman. And who do you think it was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Doctor had no idea who it could be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Harold Nixey the architect. Such a pitiful
object! Did you know, Josiah, that he is now
quite blind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah was aware of the fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How sad, how very sad!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;And he
has done so well, so wonderfully well, in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerty considered it nothing less than a calamity&mdash;for
an architect of all people. And for one who
promised such great things.</p>

<p>Sally was apparently absorbed in talk with the
Corporal, but she lifted her eyes quickly. &ldquo;Blind,
did you say? Harold Nixey?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gerty. &ldquo;Such a grievous thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, it is that!&rdquo; The voice of Josiah was heavy
and somber.</p>

<p>Ethel hoped for his recovery.</p>

<p>Her father shook his head. &ldquo;From what they tell
me the sight is completely destroyed. I was with the
lad yesterday.&rdquo; It was clear from Josiah&rsquo;s manner
that he was moved by real feeling. &ldquo;Wonderful pluck
and cheerfulness. He knows he&rsquo;ll never draw another
elevation, but he pretends to that old mother
of his that he&rsquo;s going to get better&mdash;just to keep her
going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you say, Father&rdquo;&mdash;it was the slow precise
voice of Sally&mdash;&ldquo;that he can&rsquo;t get better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a dog&rsquo;s chance from what Minyard the eye
doctor tells me. It&rsquo;s a gas those devils have been using.&rdquo;
The Mayor sighed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good lad, is that.
And he&rsquo;d have gone far. Rose from nothing, as you
might say, but in a year or two he&rsquo;d have been at the
top of the tree.&rdquo; Josiah, whose gospel was &ldquo;getting
on,&rdquo; again sighed heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go and see him, Father, if you&rsquo;ll give
me his address.&rdquo; Again the slow, precise voice of
Sally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do. It&rsquo;ll be a kindness. Number Fourteen, Torrington
Avenue. The second turn on the right past
the Brewery along Corfield Road. Pleased to have
a visit from you, I&rsquo;m sure. He talked about you a
lot. His mother had read him the <i>Tribune&rsquo;s</i> account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>of Thursday. He says he used to know you in London
when he was studying at South Kensington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under Sally&rsquo;s deep tan the blood imperceptibly
mounted. &ldquo;Yes, I used to know him quite well.&rdquo;
She didn&rsquo;t add that she had refused rather peremptorily
to marry him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go and see him, gel. A very good soldier
they tell me&mdash;D.S.O. and M.C. with two bars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Two</i> bars, Josiah!&rdquo; Gerty put up her glasses
impressively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And earned &rsquo;em&mdash;they tell me. Come to think of
it, it&rsquo;s wonderful what some of these young chaps
have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And some of the older ones, too, Josiah.&rdquo; Gerty
looked across at the Corporal who was toying pensively
with a cigarette that had been pressed upon
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, and some of the old uns, too!&rdquo; The Mayor
followed the glance of his sister-in-law with the eye
of perfect candor. &ldquo;And not been brought up to it,
mark you. They tell me our B.B. is second to none
in the British Army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal looked as if he would like to have
confirmed the Mayor&rsquo;s statement had he not remembered
that professional etiquette required so delicate
a topic to be left exclusively to civilians.</p>

<p>Sally and Ethel went after awhile, and Josiah led
the Corporal across the hall to what he called &ldquo;his
snuggery,&rdquo; wherein he considered his business affairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>and the affairs of the City, and, although by no means
a reading man, occasionally referred to the Encyclopedia
Britannica and kindred works. He was at pains
to dispose the Corporal in comfort near the fire and
then gave him an excellent cigar and insisted on his
smoking it.</p>

<p>At first little passed between them in the way of
words. They smoked in silence, but the Corporal
could not help thinking, as he delicately savored the
best cigar he had ever held between his fingers, how
much prosperity had improved &ldquo;the Mester.&rdquo; He was
so much mellower, so much more generous than of
yore. His outlook on the world was bigger altogether;
the Corporal&rsquo;s own outlook was larger also;
somehow, he had not the heart to resist the peace overtures
of his father-in-law.</p>

<p>Said Josiah at last, pointing to the Corporal&rsquo;s leg:
&ldquo;A longish job, I expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctors seemed to think it might be. Still it
had got the turn now. It was beginning to mend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering,&rdquo; said the Mayor, &ldquo;whether
it mightn&rsquo;t be possible to get you transferred to munitions.
Johnson and Hartley are short o&rsquo; foremen.
Pound a day to begin with. What do you say, my
boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal gazed into the fire without saying
anything.</p>

<p>Said the Mayor, half apologetically, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
so young as you were, you see. Forty-three, they tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>me, is a bit long in the tooth for the trenches. And
you&rsquo;ve done your bit. Why not give some o&rsquo; the
younger ones a chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In silence the Corporal went on gazing into the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow it might be worth thinking over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal removed the cigar from his mouth
and appeared laconically to agree that it might be
worth thinking over. But the suggestion didn&rsquo;t seem
to fire him.</p>

<p>A deeper silence followed and then said the Mayor
with a certain gruff abruptness which was a partial
return to the old manner, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;ll be a good
thing for Melia to quit Love Lane. She&rsquo;s not done so
bad with the business lately, but it might be wise to
sell it now. And she&rsquo;ll be none the worse for a rest
in country air. Happen I told you that back in the
spring I bought that cottage up at Dibley that that
artist chap&mdash;I forget his name for the moment&mdash;used
to come and paint in. Rare situation&mdash;sandstone foundation&mdash;highest
point in the county&mdash;see for miles
from his studio at the end o&rsquo; the garden. Don&rsquo;t quite
know why I bought it except that it was going cheap.
An old property&mdash;nobody seemed to fancy it&mdash;but the
freehold is not going to get less in value if I&rsquo;m a
judge o&rsquo; such matters and the place is in pretty good
condition. Suppose, my boy, you and Melia moved
in there? Save me a caretaker, and some o&rsquo; the finest
air in Europe comes down the valley of the Sharrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>The heart of the Corporal leaped at these amazing
words, but his eyes were still fixed upon the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the name o&rsquo; that artist chap? A local
man, but quite well up, they tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stanning, R.A.&rdquo; Something hard and queer rose
in the Corporal&rsquo;s throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the jockey&mdash;Stanning, R.A. Now I remember
... a rare dust there was in the Council some
years ago when the Art Committee bought one of his
pictures for....&rdquo; The Mayor drew heavily at his
cigar ... &ldquo;for ... dram it! I&rsquo;m losing my memory....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand guineas,&rdquo; the Corporal whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something like that. Something extortionate. I
remember there was a proper dust when the Council
got to know of it. All very well to encourage local
talent, I remember saying, but a thousand guineas was
money. Maxon the curator resigned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal kept his eyes on the fire.</p>

<p>With a rich chuckle the Mayor turned over the cigar
in his mouth at the memory of old battles in the Council
Chamber. &ldquo;The fur flew for a bit, I can tell you.
He wasn&rsquo;t an R.A. at that time and the poor chap&rsquo;s
gone now so happen he&rsquo;ll begin to rank as an old
master. They tell me fabulous sums are paid for
these old masters, so one o&rsquo; these days Stanning,
R.A., may grow into money and the City&rsquo;ll have a
bargain after all. But I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand
such things myself. A brave man, anyway. Joined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>up with the B.B. at the beginning and was killed out
yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal nodded but said nothing. The Mayor
went on with his cigar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to remember the
name of another artist chap who used to live in that
cottage when I was a boy. We used to jang from
school on fine afternoons in the summer and go bathing
in Corfield Weir. And painting by the river
was an old chap with a long beard like Tennyson&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
seen the picture of Tennyson&rdquo;&mdash;Josiah pointed
to a lithograph of the bard on the wall behind the
Corporal&mdash;&ldquo;but not quite so fierce looking. Wonderful
blue eyes had that old feller ... lord love me,
what <i>did</i> they call him!... I remember we used to
throw stones at his easel. We got one right through
it once, when he had nearly finished his picture and
he had to begin all over again. What <i>was</i> the name
of the old feller?&rdquo; The Mayor fingered his cigar
lovingly and looked into the fire. &ldquo;Soft Billy ...
that was it.... Soft Billy.&rdquo; Josiah sighed gently.
&ldquo;Poor, harmless old boy. I can see those blue eyes
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor drew gently at his cigar while the Corporal
kept his eyes on the fire. &ldquo;That reminds me....
I&rsquo;ve got one of the old chap&rsquo;s pictures, somewhere.&rdquo;
The Mayor laughed softly to himself. &ldquo;Took
it for a bad debt ... quite a small thing ... wonder
what&rsquo;s become of it?&rdquo; He grew pensive. &ldquo;Must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>be up in the box room.&rdquo; Suddenly he rose from his
chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see if I can find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man of action went out of the room, leaving
the Corporal in silent enjoyment of warmth, the tobacco
and many reflections.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Josiah returned in triumph with
a small piece of unframed canvas in his hand. He
rang the bell for a duster, of which it was much in
need, and when the duster had been duly applied he
held the picture up to the light. &ldquo;It wants a frame.&rdquo;
The tone was indulgent but casual. &ldquo;Looks like Dibley
Chase to me.&rdquo; He handed the landscape to the
Corporal who gazed at it with wistful eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dibley Chase was always a favorite pitch for these
artist chaps. See the Sharrow gleaming between the
trees?&rdquo; Josiah traced with his finger the line of the
river. &ldquo;I like that bit o&rsquo; sun creeping down the valley.
Good work in it, I daresay ... but I don&rsquo;t
pretend to be up in such matters. Very small but it
may be worth a frame. Been up in the attic at Waterloo
Villa for years ... aye, long before Waterloo
Villa....&rdquo; Josiah took a loving puff of his cigar.
&ldquo;I must have had that picture when I first went to the
Duke o&rsquo; Wellington in March, &rsquo;79. How time gets
on! Had it of that lame chap who used to keep the
Corfield Arms who went up the spout finally. Used to
supply him with beer. Gave me this for a barrel he
couldn&rsquo;t pay for.&rdquo; The Mayor laughed richly and
put on his spectacles. &ldquo;Can you see the name o&rsquo; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>artist? What was the name o&rsquo; that old Soft Billy
... ha, there it is.&rdquo; The Mayor brought his thumb
to bear on the right-hand corner. &ldquo;&lsquo;J. Torrington,
1854&rsquo; ... a long time ago. John Torrington, that
was his name ... some of his work grew in value,
I&rsquo;ve heard say. A harmless old man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor sighed a little and gave himself up to
old memories while the Corporal held the picture in
his hand. &ldquo;Soft Jack ... aye, that was his name....
I can see him now with his white beard and long
hair ... I&rsquo;m speakin&rsquo; of fifty years ago. Soft Jack,
yes ... had been a good painter so they said ...
but an old man, then. Used to sit by the Weir painting
the sun on the water. I&rsquo;ve pitched many a stone
at his easel ... in the summertime after bathing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal was too absorbed in the picture to
heed the Mayor&rsquo;s reminiscences. Josiah laughed softly
at his thoughts and chose a second cigar. &ldquo;Too
small to be worth much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But Melia might
like it. She was always a one for pictures. We&rsquo;ll pop
a bit o&rsquo; the <i>Tribune</i> round it and she can stick it in
the front parlor up at Dibley where the old boy lived
and died.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XLVI">XLVI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE next morning, Monday, towards eleven
o&rsquo;clock, Sally dropped expertly off the municipal
tram, without waiting for it to stop, at the second turn
on the right past the Brewery, along the suburban end
of the Corfield Road, and entered a street that she
had never seen before.</p>

<p>Torrington Avenue was one of those thoroughfares
on the edge of large cities that seem to spring into
being in a day and a night. In spite of the obvious
haste with which its small houses had been flung together
it was not unpleasing. But when Sally was
last in her native city, a year before the war, this area
had been a market garden.</p>

<p>Number Fourteen was a well kept little dwelling in
the middle of a neat row. Just as Sally reached it,
an old woman with a wicker shopping basket came
out of the iron gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Nixey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The visitor had recognized the old lady but the
converse did not hold true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember me, Mrs. Nixey. I&rsquo;m Sally
Munt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady gave vent to surprise, pleasure, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>credulity.
But even then she was not able to identify
one who but a few years ago had been almost as
familiar to her as her own son until Sally had lifted
her cap and rolled back the fur collar of her immense
khaki overcoat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; The old woman&rsquo;s voice was shrill
and excited. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> Miss Munt. I <i>am</i> pleased to see
you, my dear.&rdquo; The distinguished visitor suddenly
received a peck on a firm brown cheek. &ldquo;He knows
all about you. I read him the account of the doings
at the Floral Hall. He wanted to be there, but the
Doctor thought it wouldn&rsquo;t be good for him. It <i>is</i>
kind of you to come and see him.... It&rsquo;ll please him
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally cut the old lady short with a brief, pointed
question or two. He was very well in health except
that he couldn&rsquo;t see, but he was always telling his
mother that he was quite sure he would be able to
see presently, although Dr. Minyard had told her privately
that he couldn&rsquo;t promise anything.</p>

<p>The old lady led the way along the short path and
applied a latchkey to the front door. As it opened,
Sally caught the delicately played notes of a piano
floating softly across the tiny hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He plays for hours and hours and hours,&rdquo; said
the old lady. &ldquo;Your dear father has just given him
a beautiful new piano. He&rsquo;s been such a friend to
Harold. Wonderful the interest he&rsquo;s taken in him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She opened the door of a small sitting room, whence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>the music came, but the player wholly absorbed did
not hear them enter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harold, who do you think has come to see you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the piano stopped and the musician swung round
slowly on his stool, Sally shivered at the pallor of
the face and the closed eyes. She saw that tears were
trickling from them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Munt has come to see you.&rdquo; There was excitement
in the voice of the old lady. &ldquo;You remember
Miss Sally of Waterloo Villa. And to think what
we&rsquo;ve been reading about her in the <i>Tribune</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The musician sprang up with a boy&rsquo;s impulsiveness.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say, Mother&mdash;you don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; The
eager voice had a music of its own. &ldquo;Where are you,
Miss Sally?&rdquo; He held out his hand. &ldquo;Put your hand
there and then I shall believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally did as she was asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, it&rsquo;s really the great and famous you.&rdquo;
He seemed to caress that strong and competent paw
with his delicate fingers.</p>

<p>She couldn&rsquo;t find the courage to say anything.</p>

<p>But he did not allow the silence to become awkward.
&ldquo;Better go and look after your coupons,
Mother, while Miss Sally and I talk shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon that plain hint the old lady went away, closing
the front door after her, and then the blind man
helped the visitor to take off her heavy coat and put
her into a chair. He found his way back to the music
stool without difficulty, but in sitting down he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>brushed the keys of the piano with his coat sleeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your dear, good father gave me this. A wonderful
improvement on the one we&rsquo;ve scrapped. Did you
hear me murdering Beethoven as you came in? One&rsquo;s
only chance now to score off the poor blighters!&rdquo; His
cheerfulness, his whimsical courage, were amazing to
Sally. &ldquo;Since last we met things have happened,
haven&rsquo;t they? South Kensington Tube Station, December,
1913. Æons ago.&rdquo; He sighed like a child.
&ldquo;By the way, tell me, did you get a letter I sent to you
when you did your &lsquo;go&rsquo; of time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally had received the letter. Soft the admission
and also blushing, although he could not see that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t meant as an impertinence, though perhaps
it was one. Always doing the wrong things at that
time, wasn&rsquo;t I? And I&rsquo;m saying &rsquo;em now. Born under
bad stars.&rdquo; He laughed a little and paused. &ldquo;Jove!
what wonderful things you&rsquo;ve done, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had luck.&rdquo; Her voice was firm at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not more than you deserve. Hell of a time in Serbia
... must have had. Don&rsquo;t know how you managed
to come through it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the stars.&rdquo; Sally laughed a little now. But
never in her life had she felt so little like laughing.
She remembered that she used to think him a bounder;
she remembered how much his proposal had annoyed
her. Yet he was just the same now&mdash;the same Harold
Nixey&mdash;only raised to a higher power. Once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>she had despised his habit of thinking aloud, yet now
it almost enchanted her....</p>

<p>But she was not very forthcoming. He seemed to
have to do the talking for both. &ldquo;Fritz beginning to
get cold feet, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing now?&rdquo; It was the dry tone
of the professional soldier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m detailed for special duty in France.&rdquo; The tone
of Sally was professional also.</p>

<p>He sighed a gentle, &ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Off to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sighed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not until last evening,&rdquo;&mdash;her voice changed
oddly&mdash;&ldquo;that I heard you were at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice of you to come and see me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
must excuse the room being in a litter.&rdquo; There was
a table in the center on which was a drawing board,
geometrical instruments, many sheets of paper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been trying to work. I&rsquo;m always trying ... but
... you need eyes to be an architect ... you need
eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally was suddenly pierced by the thought of his
ambition and his passion for work. He was going to
do so much, he had begun so well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an idea for a new cathedral for Louvain.
Been studying ecclesiastical architecture for years in
my spare time.&rdquo; As he paused his face looked ghastly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in my head ... but....&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible&rdquo;&mdash;she could hardly speak&mdash;&ldquo;for any
one to help you&mdash;in the details, I mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would have to get right inside my mind ...
some one practical ... yet very sympathetic ... and
then the chances are that it wouldn&rsquo;t work out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; He was curiously
frank. &ldquo;I tell myself it might, just to keep going.
There&rsquo;s always the bare chance if I get the right person
to help me ... some one with great intelligence,
great insight, great sympathy, yet without ideas of
their own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean they wouldn&rsquo;t have to know too much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it ... not know too much. They would
have to sink their individuality in ... in one who
couldn&rsquo;t.... Your father suggested a partnership.
But it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair, would it? Besides I should
be terribly trying to work with ... terribly trying
... perhaps impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you would be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a partnership, yes. It couldn&rsquo;t answer. I&rsquo;m so
creative.... I have always to stamp myself on my
work ... if you know what I mean. Then ... as
I say ... I don&rsquo;t know yet ... that ... I can
pick up all the threads that have been....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need,&rdquo; said Sally slowly and softly, &ldquo;some intelligent
amateur, capable of drawing a ground plan,
who would give himself up to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw up his head eagerly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it ...
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>somebody quite intelligent ... but without ambition
... who would&rdquo;&mdash;the voice began to tail off queerly&mdash;&ldquo;have
the courage ... not to mind ... the ferocious
egotism ... of the ... baffled.&rdquo; Suddenly he
covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t take me very long to learn the rudiments,
I think,&rdquo; said Sally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather quick at picking
up the things that interest me. It would be enormously
interesting to see what could be done with this&mdash;this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are off to France to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The war won&rsquo;t last forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tone of her voice startled him. His heart leapt
queerly. There was a time, not so long ago, when he
would have given his soul to have surprised just that
note in it. He began to shake violently.</p>

<p>With all the will his calamity had left him he strove
to hold himself in. Her voice was music, her nearness
magical; what she offered him now was beyond
his wildest hopes. Once he had jumped at her too
soon, in a moment of delirium; but he had always
known, by force of the strong temperament, that was
such a torment to him now, that she was the only
woman in the world he would ever really care for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see just the kind of helper you need.&rdquo; Divinely
practical, yet divinely modern! &ldquo;I could mug up my
drawing in a week or two and I should never know
enough to want to interfere with anything that mattered.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>He held himself tensely like one who sees a precipice
yawning under his feet. &ldquo;America coming in,
do you think?&rdquo; It was a heroic change of voice.
&ldquo;I wish she would. I&rsquo;m afraid it may be a draw
without her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally, with all her ribbons and her uniform, could
rise to no immediate interest in America.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our poor lads have had an awful grueling on the
Somme. Seven hundred thousand casualties and nothing
to show for it so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; The sightless eyes were lacerating her.
&ldquo;They ought to help us. It&rsquo;s their war as much as
it&rsquo;s ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t blame them for staying out. Can&rsquo;t blame
anybody for staying out. But we&rsquo;ll never get the
right peace unless they help us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some people think they&rsquo;d not make much difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; It was the vehemence she used not to
like. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d simply tip the scale. Have you ever
been there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have. Some country, America. They&rsquo;ve pinched
our best Torrington, curse them ... not that that took
me there. One afternoon, though, I happened to be
looking for it in a moldy, one-horse museum just off
Washington Square&mdash;I forget the name of it&mdash;when
I walked straight into the arms of dear old Jim Stan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>ning
who had actually come all the way from Europe
on purpose to gaze at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally emitted becoming surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you read that in a novel you&rsquo;d say it was the
sort of thing that doesn&rsquo;t happen. But it did happen.
Fancy old Jim coming all those miles by flood and
field to look at a strip of canvas not as big as that
drawing board. &lsquo;The Valley of the Sharrow on an afternoon
in July.&rsquo; By the way, did you ever happen to
meet him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally had never met Stanning the painter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the whitest men that ever lived. Lies out
there. A great chap, Jim Stanning. Another Torrington
almost for a certainty ... although he doubted
himself, whether he was big enough to fight his own
success. See what he meant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It thrilled him a little when he realized that she
did.</p>

<p>For an instant the extinguished eyes seemed to well
with light. &ldquo;That picture of his, &lsquo;As the Leaves of the
Tree,&rsquo; carries technique to a point that makes one
dizzy. Some say technique doesn&rsquo;t matter, but there&rsquo;s
nothing permanent without it.&rdquo; He sighed heavily.
&ldquo;Of course the undaunted soul of man has to shine
through it. And that&rsquo;s just what Jim Stanning was&mdash;an
undaunted soul. Dead at thirty-nine. We shan&rsquo;t
realize ... if we ever realize ... however....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overcome by his thoughts for a moment, he could
not go on. Sally sat breathing hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were a rich man, as rich as Ford or Carnegie,
I&rsquo;d buy that picture of old Jim&rsquo;s and send it to them in
Berlin. Some day it might help them to ask themselves
just what it was that brought the man who
painted it, a man who simply lived for beauty, to die
like a dog, half mad, in a poisoned muckyard in Flanders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped and the light seemed to die in
his face. Then he turned round on the piano stool and
broke delicately into the opening bars of the haunted,
wild and terrible Fifth Symphony. For the moment
he had forgotten that Sally was there.</p>

<p>She got up from her chair and came to him as a
child to a wounded and suffering animal. Putting an
arm round his clean but frayed collar she kissed his
forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall come and see you again ... if I may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His sightless flesh seemed to contract as he lifted his
thin hands from the keyboard. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he gasped.
&ldquo;Better not ... better not ... for both of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knew he was right and something in her voice
told him so. &ldquo;... If I may,&rdquo; she repeated weakly.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t answer. She pressed her lips again upon
his forehead, then took up her coat and went hastily
from the room.</p>

<p>The old woman was in the act of turning the latchkey
in the front door. She had got her coupons and
was returning in triumph with a full basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not going, Miss Sally, are you? I should like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>you to have seen his decorations&mdash;D.S.O. with two
Bars and such a wonderful letter from the General.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I simply must go, Mrs. Nixey. Off to
France to-morrow, and I&rsquo;ve got to pack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, I suppose so. Very good of you
to come and see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the sight of Sally&rsquo;s eyes the voice of the old
woman changed suddenly. &ldquo;He thinks, my dear, he&rsquo;ll
get better ... he quite thinks he&rsquo;ll get better ... but
... but, Dr. Minyard....&rdquo; Again the voice of the
old woman changed. &ldquo;Ah, there he is playing again.
How beautifully he does play, doesn&rsquo;t he? Hours
... and hours ... and hours. So soft and gentle
... the bit he&rsquo;s playing now reminds him of the wind
in Dibley Chase. Yes, and that bit too ... he says
it makes him see the sun dancing along the Sharrow
on an afternoon in July. Beautiful piano! So kind
and thoughtful of your dear father! He quite thinks
... he&rsquo;ll....&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="XLVII">XLVII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Corporal&rsquo;s leg was a long time getting well.</p>

<p>First it came on a bit, then it went back a bit;
but the process of recovery was a painful and a tardy
business. Still it was much softened by the judicious
help of others. By the interest of the Mayor of the
city, whose model hospital on The Rise and its last
word in equipment meant access to more than one
influential ear, Corporal Hollis in the later stages of
a long convalescence had the privileges of an out
patient.</p>

<p>These privileges, moreover, were enjoyed in ideal
conditions. Early in April, Melia was installed at
Torrington Cottage, Dibley. To the secret gratification
of her family, the business in Love Lane was
given up, and Melia&rsquo;s checkered life entered upon a
new phase amid surroundings wholly different from
any it had known before.</p>

<p>At first the change seemed almost too great to be
enjoyed. After the gloom, the semi-squalor, the hard
toil of Love Lane, it was like an entrance into paradise.
And when, at the end of that enchanted month
of April, the Corporal joined her in the new abode,
Melia&rsquo;s cup of happiness seemed quite perilously full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>That was a summer of magic days. For weeks
on end they lived in a dream that had come true. To
Melia the well appointed house, the beautiful surroundings,
the bounty of her father were sources of perpetual
amazement; to the Corporal the extensive garden,
so gloriously stocked with flowers, fruit and vegetables,
was a thing of delight; above all, the tower
at the end of it, commanding on every hand his lovely
native county, was a sacred thing, a temple of august
memories.</p>

<p>The Corporal sunning himself and smoking his pipe
by the south wall, where the peaches grew, could never
have believed it to be possible. Melia, tending the
flowerbeds and the grass, at the end of a not-too-strenuous
summer&rsquo;s day, felt somehow that this was fairyland.
Yes, their dreams of the long ago had more
than come true. And, crowning consummation, in the
eyes of each other, they were honored husband and
cherished wife.</p>

<p>The Corporal was a long time getting well, but in
that he was obeying instructions. Those most competent
to speak of his case had told him not to be
in a hurry; otherwise he might be permanently lame.
And he was entitled to take his time. He had done
his bit. Moreover, as his father-in-law assured him,
it was the turn of younger men to &ldquo;carry on.&rdquo; He had
been through more than a year and a half in the
trenches amid some of the cruelest fighting of the
war; he was entitled to wear two stripes of gold braid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>on his sleeve. If any man could nurse a painful injury
with a good conscience that man was Corporal
Hollis.</p>

<p>In spite of searing memories, in spite of the whole
nation&rsquo;s anxieties, in a measure made less, yet not
wholly dispelled by the entrance into the war of a
great Ally, the Corporal was allowed a taste of those
half-forbidden fruits, Poetry and Romance. At such
a time, perhaps, with the issue still undecided and the
trials of the people growing more severe every week,
the gilt on life&rsquo;s gingerbread should have been denied
him altogether. And yet by dogged pluck he had
earned that guerdon, and Melia by her simple faith
was worthy to share it with him.</p>

<p>The famous erection at the end of the garden, a
weathercock at its apex, a course of bricks and twelve
stone steps at its base, was haunted continually by
an unseen presence. And it was a presence with whom
the Corporal long communed. Many an odd hour between
sunrise and sunset, a humble disciple of the
Highest, pencil or brush in hand, strove with hardly
more than infantile art to surprise some of the secrets
of woodland, stream and hill.</p>

<p>No wonder that at that particular corner, where
mile upon lovely mile of England rolled back to the
frontiers of three counties, two of her greatest painters
had gloried in Beauty and drunk deep. The lights
tossed from the sky to the silver-breasted river gleaming
a thousand feet below and then cast back again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>were so many heralds and sconce-bearers for those
who had eyes to see.</p>

<p>When the Corporal was not being wheeled round
his enchanted garden, or was not smoking his pipe in
the sun, he was sitting with his back to the weather,
drawing and painting and dwelling in spirit with the
genius of place and, through it, with one immortal
friend.</p>

<p>Autumn came and the Corporal still needed a
crutch. But he could get about the garden now and
even pluck the weeds, although not yet able to dig.
And he was so happy that he didn&rsquo;t chafe against
the slow recovery. He needed rest and he had earned
it; of that there could be no question.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the months passed and events moved
quickly. The war, to which no glimpse of an end
was yet in sight, continued to press ever more severely
upon all sections of the population. There
was a shortage of everything now except the spirit
of grim determination. It was a people&rsquo;s war, as no
war had ever been, and the people, come what might,
were set on winning it.</p>

<p>In November the signal compliment was paid Josiah
of electing him to office a third consecutive year.
If anything, his second term had enhanced his prestige;
his authority in the city of Blackhampton was
greater than ever. More and more did he seem to
be the man such abnormal times required. And the
Mayoress, although under the constant threat of dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>solution
throughout a strenuous year, was still in the
land of the living. Looking back on what she had
suffered, the fact appeared miraculous; and yet as the
end of the second term drew near, had she been quite
honest with herself, she might have been tempted to
own that she was none the worse for her experience.
In some ways, although the admission would have
called for wild horses, she might almost be said to be
the better for it. Gertrude Preston, at any rate, openly
said so.</p>

<p>Such being the case, Josiah did not hesitate to accept
office for a third term. By now he realized that
he was the best man in the city, at all events for that
particular job. Everybody said so, from the Town
Clerk down; and it was no mere figure of speech. Indeed,
Josiah felt that Blackhampton could hardly
&ldquo;carry on&rdquo; without him.</p>

<p>He was an autocrat, it was true, his temper was
despotic, but that was the kind of man the times called
for. It was no use having a divided mind, it was
no use having a mealy-mouth. With the political instinct
of a hardheaded race he had contrived to find
a formula of government. He could talk to Labor
in the language it understood; and the employers of
Labor allowed him to talk to them, perhaps mainly
for the reason that he was not himself an employer,
but a disinterested and, if anything, slightly too honest,
private citizen.</p>

<p>Therefore, no great surprise was caused at the be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>ginning
of the New Year when it was announced that
the dignity of a Knight of the British Empire had
been conferred upon the Mayor of Blackhampton.
Sir Josiah Munt, K.B.E., took it as &ldquo;all in the day&rsquo;s
work.&rdquo; A democrat pur sang, yet he didn&rsquo;t doubt
&ldquo;that he&rsquo;d make as good a knight as some of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
But the hapless Maria showed less stoicism. According
to credible witnesses, when the news came to her
that Lady Munt was her future style and degree,
she fainted right off, and when at last the assiduous
Alice had brought her to, she put herself to bed for
three days.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, old issues were revived in that tormented
breast. Horace, Doctor Cockburn, had immensely
strengthened his position in the triumphant
course of the preceding year, but the new situation
cried aloud for Doctor Tremlett. However, the
Mayor telephoned to his sister-in-law &ldquo;to come at
once and set her ladyship to rights,&rdquo; the call was
promptly obeyed by the dauntless Gerty, and the
crisis passed.</p>

<h2 id="XLVIII">XLVIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE early months of the year 1918 saw the entire
Allied Cause in the gravest jeopardy. Even
a superficial study of facts only partially revealed
has made it clear that disaster was invited by an almost
criminal taking of chances. The time is not
yet for the whole truth to be known. Meanwhile the
muse of history continues to weave her Dædalian
spells....</p>

<p>On the last Sunday morning of that momentous
and terrible March the Mayor sent his car to Torrington
Cottage. Melia and her husband had been
invited to spend the day at Strathfieldsaye. For several
months the Corporal had been working at a new
aerodrome along the valley, which happened to be
within easy reach of his tricycle. His last Medical
Board had proved that his leg was still weak and in
its opinion not unlikely to remain so. But he had
not been invalided out of the Army, as there was still
a chance that presently he might be able to pass the
doctor; at the same time, having regard to his age
and the nature of his injury, he had a reasonable hope
of getting his discharge whenever he cared to apply
for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>More than once had Melia urged him to do so. Her
arguments were strong. He was not a young man
and he had already &ldquo;done his bit&rdquo;; they were very
happy together in their charming house; and her
father had said that it would continue to be theirs as
long as they cared to live in it. The Corporal, however,
could not quite bring himself to quit the Army,
even had such a course been possible. Something still
held him. He didn&rsquo;t know exactly what it was, but
even now that the chance had been given him he was
loathe &ldquo;to cut the painter.&rdquo; Pride seemed to lie at
the root of his reluctance. Melia felt it must be that.
But the Corporal knew that alchemies more potent
were at work.</p>

<p>On this fateful Sunday in March, after the midday
meal, as he sat smoking one of his father-in-law&rsquo;s cigars
in the little room across the hall he realized that
pressure was being brought to bear upon him to make
a decision. Moreover, in Josiah&rsquo;s arguments, he
heard the voice of his wife. Melia had lately astonished
the world with the news that she was expecting
a baby. The fact was very hard to credit that
she was now preparing clothes for her first-born.
A nine days&rsquo; wonder had ensued. Such a thing was
almost beyond precedent, yet, after all, Dame Nature
had been known to indulge in these caprices! The
startled, fluttered, rather piqued Mrs. Doctor, after
consultation with her lord, was able to furnish instances.
Still, it was remarkable! And it lent much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>cogency to Melia&rsquo;s desire that the Corporal should now
apply for his discharge from the Army.</p>

<p>This afternoon it was clear that Josiah was pleading
Melia&rsquo;s case. There was an excellent billet waiting
for the Corporal at Jackson and Holcroft&rsquo;s if he
cared to take it. They offered short hours and good
pay. Why not? He was still going a trifle lame;
the Medical Board was not likely to raise any objection;
and it would be a relief to Melia who ought to
be considered now.</p>

<p>The Corporal, however, shifted uneasily in his chair.
All through luncheon he had seemed terribly gloomy;
and, if anything, his father-in-law&rsquo;s arguments had
deepened the clouds. One reason was, perhaps, that
Josiah himself was terribly gloomy. The whole country
was terribly gloomy. It had suddenly swung back
to the phase of August, 1914.</p>

<p>The simple truth was that disaster was in the air.
A crushing blow had fallen, a blow doubly cruel because
so long foreseen and, therefore, to be parried
if not actually prevented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over a wide front the British Army is beaten!&rdquo;
Such was the enemy message to the Sunday papers.
&ldquo;Ninety thousand prisoners and an enormous booty
have been taken!&rdquo; And the greatest disaster in the
long history of British arms was confirmed by the
artless official meiosis. &ldquo;Our Fourth and Fifth Armies
have retired to a previously prepared position.&rdquo; It
omitted to state that the position was some thirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>miles nearer Paris, but that fact received confirmation
from the French communiqué in the next column,
&ldquo;The capital is being bombarded by long-range guns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No day could have been less propitious for Melia.
And after the Mayor had sat smoking a few minutes
with his gloomy son-in-law he appeared to realize the
state of the case. As the Corporal drew at his cigar
in a silence that was almost morose, Josiah&rsquo;s own
thoughts and feelings began to take color from their
surroundings. He lapsed into silence also. It seemed
to come home to him all at once and for the first time
in his life that he had been guilty of impertinence.
This little man with his bloodshot eyes and few struggling
wisps of gray hair, with his twitching hands and
his air of smoldering rage, had been through it. Even
to have been Mayor of Blackhampton three years
running was very little by comparison. Josiah was
man enough to feel keenly annoyed for having allowed
his tongue so free a rein.</p>

<p>There came at last a deep growl from the Corporal.
It was the note of an old dog, whose life of many
battles has not improved his temper. &ldquo;If the bloody
politicians will interfere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words found an echo in the heart of the Mayor.
Sinister tales were rife on every hand. And of his
own knowledge he was aware that there were hundreds
of thousands of trained men in the country at
that moment whose presence was most imperatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>called for on the perilously weakened and extended
British line to France.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to call up the grandads, I see,&rdquo; said the Corporal,
grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; The Mayor laughed bitterly. &ldquo;Fat lot o&rsquo;
use they&rsquo;ll be when they&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em. Muddle, muddle,
muddle.&rdquo; Like the Corporal, he was in a very black
humor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mercy the Yankees are with us now&mdash;if
they are not in too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fancy muckin&rsquo; it,&rdquo; said the Corporal, &ldquo;with the
game in our hands. A year ago we&rsquo;d got &rsquo;em beat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Press government,&rdquo; said Josiah savagely.</p>

<p>The Corporal proceeded to chew a good cigar.
&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; he said at last, and it was the first time in his
life he had addressed his former employer so familiarly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll have to go before the Medical
Board again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah combed an incipient goatee with a dubious
forefinger. &ldquo;But, my boy, from what you told me,
you thought you could get your discharge any time
you liked to ask for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was back in January.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no fitter now than you were then, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal slowly stretched his right leg to its
full length, and then, gathering it under him leant
his whole weight upon it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much firmer on my
pins than I was then.&rdquo; His rough voice suddenly
regained its usual gentleness. &ldquo;Work seems to suit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>me.&rdquo; He laughed rather wryly. &ldquo;I expect the
Board&rsquo;ll pass me now&mdash;if I ask &rsquo;em to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the turn of Josiah to maltreat his cigar. &ldquo;Not
thinking of going back into the Line, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;ll take me.&rdquo; The Corporal spoke slowly
and softly. &ldquo;And I daresay they will&mdash;if I ask &rsquo;em
polite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah&rsquo;s keen face was full of queer emotion. &ldquo;Not
for me to say anything.&rdquo; But he had been charged
with a mission by the urgent Melia. No matter what
his private feelings let him not betray it! &ldquo;Seems
to me, my boy, although it&rsquo;s not for me to say anything,
that no one&rsquo;ll blame you, after what you&rsquo;ve
been through, if you stand aside and make room for
others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Corporal extended both legs towards the fire.
He gazed into it solemnly without speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, think it over, Bill.&rdquo; The voice of the
tempter. &ldquo;No one can blame you, if you stick to
your present billet, which suits you so well&mdash;or even
if you go into munitions at a good salary. You&rsquo;ll
have earned anything they give you. And in a manner
o&rsquo; speaking you&rsquo;ll still be doing your bit. But
as I say ... it&rsquo;s not for me....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strangling a groan, the Corporal rose suddenly
from his chair, &ldquo;I must think it over.&rdquo; He threw the
stump of his cigar into the fire. &ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t like
leaving the Chaps.&rdquo; The voice of the Corporal sank
almost to a whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mayor gave his guest a second cigar and chose
another for himself. But he didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;as you might say&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had Experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor looked a little queerly at the Corporal.
Then he took a penknife out of the pocket of a rather
ornate knitted waistcoat and dexterously removed
the tip from his cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had Experience.&rdquo; The Corporal sighed and
sat down heavily in his cushioned chair. He fixed
his eyes again on the fire.</p>

<p>The Mayor applied a lighted spill to his cigar and
then in silence offered it to the Corporal. But the
Corporal&rsquo;s cigar was not yet ready for smoking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do go&rdquo;&mdash;the voice of the Corporal was soft
and thick and rather husky&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll ... you&rsquo;ll....&rdquo;</p>

<p>His father-in-law nodded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about
that. I&rsquo;ll see <i>her</i> all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josiah took out his handkerchief and blew his nose
violently.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="XLIX">XLIX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HAT evening, about nine o&rsquo;clock, when Melia
and the Corporal returned to Torrington Cottage,
they found a cosy fire awaiting them in the
charming sitting room, an act of grace on the part
of Fanny, a handmaiden from the village, for the
evenings were chilly. They sat a few minutes together
and then Melia retired for the night after having
drawn a promise from the Corporal that he would
not be long in following her example.</p>

<p>Alas, the Corporal did not feel in the least like going
to bed. There was a decision to be made. In fact
he had half made it already. But the good wife upstairs
and the very chair in which he sat had cast
their spells upon him. Gazing into the heart of the
fire he realized that he was deliciously and solidly comfortable.
All his days he had been a catlike lover of
the comfortable. In the first instance it had been
that as much as anything that had so nearly undone
him. Conflicting voices were urging him, as somehow
they always did, at critical moments in his life.</p>

<p>This beautiful room with its old furniture, its
china, its bric-a-brac, its soft carpet, its one rare landscape
upon the wall was an enchanted palace. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>now, after all these months of occupation, it seemed
like sacrilege to be sitting in it. But it was a symptom
of a changed condition. This lovely place with
its poetry and its elegance was a dream come true.
And the honor and the affection with which a world
formerly so hard and so supercilious surrounded him
now made life so much sweeter than ever before.</p>

<p>Sitting there in front of a delicious fire he felt
that the peace and the beauty all about him had entered
his soul. He had a right to these languors; he
had purchased them with many unspeakable months
of torture and pain. No one would blame him, no
one could blame him if he left the dance to younger
men. Suddenly he heard a little wind steal along the
valley and he shivered at the image that was born
upon its whisper. Just beyond these cosy, lamplit
walls was Night, Chaos, Panic. Outside the tiny
harbor he had won at such a price was all hell let
loose.</p>

<p>He heard the awful Crumps, he could taste the icy
mud they flung over him, he was plunged again in
endless, hideous hours, he could see and feel the
muck, the senseless muck, the boredom, the excruciating
misery. The wind in the valley grew a little
louder and he shuddered in the depths of his spirit.</p>

<p>The crocuses were out in the fields by the river.
Next week would be April, the time of cloud, of glowing
brake and flowering thorn, of daffodils and miraculous
lights along the Sharrow. The little picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>over the chimneypiece, which he had copied three
times in his long convalescence, showed what April
meant along the Sharrow. Friendship had taught him
something, had given him eyes. He had been initiated
into the higher mysteries. Beauty for the sake of
Beauty&mdash;the world religion of the future&mdash;had been
revealed to him. The sense of it seemed to fill him
with passion as he gazed into the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Auntie!&rdquo; Surely there was a voice in the room.
Or was it the little wind outside softly trying the
shutters? &ldquo;Auntie!&rdquo; It was there again. He got
up unsteadily, but in a kind of ecstasy, half entrancement,
half pain, and crossed to the French window.
Very gently he slipped back the bolts and flung open
the door. The darkness hit him, but there was nothing
there. He knew there was nothing there, yet in
his old carpet slippers he stepped out gingerly on to
the wet lawn. The air was moist and mild and
friendly, and as his eyes grew used to the mirk the
rosebushes and the fruit trees took shape on either
hand.</p>

<p>The shafts of light from the room he had left guided
him across the grass as far as the path which led
to the tower at the end of the garden. As soon as
his feet were on the gravel he thought he heard the
voice again. Of course it couldn&rsquo;t be so. It was only
the wind along the valley. And yet ... no ... if
the wind wasn&rsquo;t calling....</p>

<p>The gaunt line of the many-windowed tower loomed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>ahead. Less by calculation than by instinct he suddenly
found the lowest of the twelve stone steps which
led to its high door&mdash;in that darkness he couldn&rsquo;t
see it, and if he had seen it there was not the slightest
reason for ascending, but just now he was possessed.
Step after step shaped itself with a kind of intelligence
to his old waterlogged slippers, the damp knob
of the door came into his hand.</p>

<p>The door was locked. Silly fool he was! Must
be cracked anyway! But the starched cuff of his best
Sunday shirt had got entangled with something. The
key, of course. It had been left in the lock. Careless
to leave it like that.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the door came open. The ghostly
abyss within smelt very damp and cheerless. Ought
to have had an occasional fire there during the winter
months. He felt his way cautiously in and his eyes
adjusted themselves to the grimmer texture of the
darkness. The chill made his teeth chatter. He felt
in his pockets for a match, but he hadn&rsquo;t got one;
he moved gingerly forward, past a wooden table and
a wicker chair; the spectral outline of an unshuttered
window confronted him.</p>

<p>Outside was nothing but the wind in the valley.
He couldn&rsquo;t see a yard beyond the glass. The chill
of the musty place was settling into his bones. What
a fool not to be in his comfortable bed! But ... a
voice was still whispering. There <i>was</i> something
... somewhere....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>The wind was just like the little wind along that
damned Canal. No wonder his teeth chattered. And
then right out in the void he saw a star. It was so
faint, so far beyond the valley and the wind&rsquo;s voice
that he was not sure it was a star. But as he stood
looking at it the voice seemed to come quite close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Auntie ... Auntie....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you, Jim ... here I am, boy....&rdquo;</p>

<p>... Only a fool would stand with chattering teeth,
in carpet slippers, at a goodish bit past midnight,
talking to something that wasn&rsquo;t there....</p>

<p>Somewhere in the darkness there was a presence.
Perhaps it was outside the window. He felt his way
back to the open door, as far as the veiled peril of the
twelve stone steps. It was so dark that he couldn&rsquo;t
even see the topmost; there was not even a railing for
such an emergency; a single false step and he would
break his neck.</p>

<p>Queerly excited he stood poised on the threshold,
feeling into space with one foot. The wind was in
the garden below him. And then oddly, at a fresh
angle, over by his left hand, he caught a glimpse of
the star. He swayed forward into the void but the
lamp of faith had been lit in his eyes. His taut nerves
awoke to the fact that he was really descending the
unseen steps one by one and that he was counting
them. If he didn&rsquo;t take extraordinary care he was
very likely to kill himself, but the care he was taking
seemed by no means extraordinary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>His old carpet slippers were shuffling along the
gravel at last. He could make out a line of currant
bushes by which ran the path to the house. As he
moved forward the wind died away in the valley and
he lost sight of the star. But he knew his way now.
Pent up forces flowed from him through the wall of
living darkness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, Jim!&rdquo; he muttered.
The wind seemed to answer him. And then he came
to the end of the row of bushes and there beyond a
patch of wet grass was the door of the cosy room
still open with a subdued glow of lamp and fire shining
beyond.</p>

<p>When he came in he took off his soaked slippers that
they might not soil the beautiful carpet of which Melia
was so proud. As he barred the door and drew
the curtains across the window, the pretty old-fashioned
clock on the chimneypiece chided him by melodiously
striking one o&rsquo;clock. He must be a fool&mdash;he
had to be up at seven; but the enchanted room that
was like a dream embodied cast one last spell upon
him.</p>

<p>He had no need ... the Chaps wouldn&rsquo;t expect it
... he was forty-five....</p>

<p>The voice was in the valley. It was a quarter past
one. He raked out the last faint embers of the fire,
then he put out the lamp and carried his wet slippers
into the hall. After his recent adventure it was but
a simple matter to find his way up the richly car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>peted
stairs without a light and creep into the room
where his wife slept.</p>

<p>She was sleeping now. So cunningly he crept into
the room that she did not stir. He listened to the
gentle rise and fall of her soft breath. Good woman!
brave woman! He tiptoed past the bed to where the
window was and managed to draw up the clever new-fangled
blinds without making a sound. Yes, there
was the star. That was all he wanted to see. Faint
it was, so faint that faith was needed to believe that
it was a star. But there was nothing else it could be.</p>

<p>The little sobbing voice, now no more than a whisper,
that, too, was out there. Jim&rsquo;s voice ... cracked
he must be ... such sloppy notions ... the wind
along that damned canal....</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned from the star. At the beck of
a queer impulse he knelt by the bed, burying his eyes
in the soft counterpane. He prayed for the Chaps.
He prayed for Melia. He prayed for the life that lay
with her, the life coming to them so miraculously they
knew not whence, after all those years.</p>

<p>Could it be that Jim was coming back to complete
his great beginnings? Coming back to witch the
world with beauty? Just a fancy. But everything was
just a fancy. Jim had said so once, looking at the
sunset on the bank of that canal.</p>

<p>And he was one who....</p>

<h2 id="L">L</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE months went by. In the meantime, upon the
fields of France, was being decided the fate of
the world for generations to come. Day followed day
whose story will echo down the ages, but in the cottage
with the green shutters at the head of the valley
there was little to indicate that it was a time of destiny.</p>

<p>The Corporal was allowed to return to his old regiment.
Experience had made him doubly valuable and
its ranks had been grievously thinned. After three
months at the Depôt he was sent to France.</p>

<p>When at the end of July he came home on draft
leave to bid Melia good-by, her time was drawing near.
And in spite of the burdens life had laid upon them,
the feeling now uppermost was a subtle sense of triumph.
In the final bitterness of conflict the dark Fates
had given them courage to bear their heads high.</p>

<p>A strange reward was coming to them, bringing
with it new obligations, new responsibilities. But they
were not afraid. Somewhere, a Friend was helping
them. It must be so, or else the dire perils to which
they had been exposed would not have allowed their
happiness to bear so late a flower. Besides, they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>been given a specific token that in the sum of things
they mattered.</p>

<p>As the Corporal held his wife in a last embrace it
came to him all at once that he was never to see the
young life that was to bear his name. &ldquo;If we can put
the job through to a finish,&rdquo; he whispered huskily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like it to be a boy. If we can&rsquo;t, a girl&rsquo;d be better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She asked why a girl would be better. As usual
she was not very quick in the uptake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world&rsquo;ll not be a place for boys&mdash;unless we
can do the job clean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will do it, Bill.&rdquo; The almost cowlike eyes
expressed a divine instinct. &ldquo;God won&rsquo;t let the Germans
win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow the words shamed him, yet not for the
reason that turned her own heart to fire. It was treason
to the Chaps to talk of girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course we&rsquo;ll make a clean job on it.&rdquo; He pressed
a final caress upon her. &ldquo;You can set there, my dear,
in that nice chair all covered with wild flowers, and
the door open just as it is, so that you can get a
glimpse o&rsquo; that old river with the sun on it and when
your eyes get tired-like, my dear, you can fix &rsquo;em on
that little picture over the chimneypiece opposite. See
what I mean, like? There&rsquo;s the sun in that, too. John
Torrington painted it. Look at it sometimes. We
are going to win&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t right to think otherwise.
That means a boy. And if a boy it is, I&rsquo;d like him
to be called Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">C</span>IVILIZATION was ringing with great news at
the very hour that a son was born to the Corporal.
But at that time he was a Corporal no longer.
A letter had already reached Melia to say that &ldquo;he was
promoted Color Sergeant.&rdquo; The fighting was awful,
but the Chaps had got their tails up, and the time was
coming &ldquo;when Fritz would be bound to throw in his
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was very well, therefore, that the half comic,
rather pathetic, somewhat crumpled but perfectly
healthy creature snuggling up against its mother in
a lovely chintz-clad bedroom looking southwest,
proved to be a small but perfectly formed specimen of
the human male. The delighted grandmother herself
took the incredible news to Strathfieldsaye.</p>

<p>Josiah, who for several days past had been hard
set to conceal a growing excitement, rubbed his hands
with glee. &ldquo;One in the eye for Park Crescent&mdash;what?
Fancy ... Melia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Munt agreed that wonders are never likely to
cease in this world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she never remembered to have seen Josiah
so excited, &ldquo;this means a bottle o&rsquo; champagne.&rdquo;
He pressed the bell and gave comprehensive orders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>to Alice. &ldquo;Seems to me that Victory&rsquo;s in the air.&rdquo;
Secretly he had always had a grudge against Fate,
that, with all his worldly success, his family could not
muster one solitary male among them. &ldquo;Funny
thing, y&rsquo; know, how you can be deceived in people.
I always said that chap Hollis was a good-for-nothing.
Well, I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her ladyship sniffed a little and wiped tearful eyes.
She was in perversely low spirits, but good soup, in
spite of the food crisis and good wine, which she was
simply forced to drink, did something to restore her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can be deceived in people.&rdquo; The cool
trickle down Josiah&rsquo;s throat generated a desire for conversation.
&ldquo;Take the Germans. Everybody thought
they were a white race. Well, they aren&rsquo;t. Then take
the Americans. Everybody said they were too proud
to fight. And, when finally they came in, people said
they&rsquo;d not be much use anyway. But it shows how
easy it is to be wrong.&rdquo; Again the Mayor took up his
glass. &ldquo;For I tell you, Mother, those Yankees have
made a difference. Since that mix-up back in March
they&rsquo;ve done wonders. The Yankees have turned the
scale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria had a head for domestic affairs only; she
did not pretend to be wise in international matters.
She sighed gently and thought of a certain chintz-clad
room up at Dibley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get on with it!&rdquo; Her lord pointed at her glass
peremptorily. &ldquo;Pol Roger &rsquo;04&rsquo;ll hurt nobody.&rdquo; Strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>in that faith, he lifted his own glass and bowed and
beamed over the top of it. &ldquo;Grandma, here&rsquo;s now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the toast Maria hoisted a blush which brought
Josiah to the verge of catastrophe. Tears, her one
form of emotional luxury, came into her honest eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a year or two, Grandma, we&rsquo;ll have to be thinking
of your golden wedding&mdash;touching wood!&rdquo; He
laid a ritualistic finger upon the mahogany. &ldquo;You
little thought, did you now, when we started out together
in that funny little box up Parker&rsquo;s Entry that
one day you&rsquo;d be My Lady? Funny world&mdash;what?
I remember going to fetch the Doctor the night that
gel was born. Bitter cold it was.&rdquo; Suddenly Josiah
stopped and again took up his glass. &ldquo;Wind had an
edge like a knife round the corner by Waterloo
Square.&rdquo; Then came an odd change of voice. &ldquo;Did I
understand you to say the gel would like me to be
godfather?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria understood that Melia understood that Bill
would like it.</p>

<p>A sigh escaped Josiah. He laid down his knife and
fork. &ldquo;Well, well, I never made such a mistake in my
life as over that chap.&rdquo; His voice grew humbler than
Maria had ever heard it. &ldquo;Shows how you can be
deceived. Something big about that feller. Never
made a greater mistake in my life. We&rsquo;ll hope he&rsquo;ll
come through. Better write him a line, Mother.
Don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;s any use tryin&rsquo; to send a wire.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="LII">LII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">S</span>OME weeks later, on a cold Sunday morning in
November, Sir Josiah and Lady Munt drove over
to Torrington Cottage. They were accompanied by
Sally, on short leave from France, and by Gertrude
Preston. Before the party walked across the village
green to the little parish church, where a service of
National Thanksgiving was to be held, it found that a
matter of great importance claimed attention.</p>

<p>The matter was Jim. The rector of the parish
had arranged to christen him that afternoon at three
o&rsquo;clock. Near a good log fire in the sunny embrasure
of the charming little drawing-room his grand cradle
had been set; and here the wonderful infant was duly
inspected by his godparents.</p>

<p>Jim was a picture. His grandfather said he was.
There was no other word. Yet even in the presence
of this phenomenal youth there was but a chastened
joy. He was sleeping for one thing, calmly, sweetly
and superbly; and his pale, fine-drawn, yet strangely
proud-looking mother was clad in the livery of widowhood.</p>

<p>Said Josiah in a low voice, so as not to wake the
baby, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to the picture that used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>be there?&rdquo; He pointed to the wall above the chimneypiece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It fell down, Dad.&rdquo; The voice of Melia was calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One night last week&mdash;the night before the news
came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; Josiah was not superstitious, still
it was queer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one was in the room when it happened. No
one heard it fall. Didn&rsquo;t break the frame or the glass
or anything. Just the snapping of the cord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;War cord, I expect.&rdquo; Josiah&rsquo;s voice was grim.
&ldquo;Need a cord of a better quality to hang a certain
party. Better have it put up again. Young Nixey
tells me that picture may be worth a sight o&rsquo; money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melia promised that it should be put up again.
<i>He</i> always set such great store by it.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, Sally, who had been wholly absorbed
in the contemplation of James, said, &ldquo;Tell me, Father,
when did you last see young Nixey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thursday&mdash;Friday. Happened to look in Friday
morning as I was passing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderfully cheerful considerin&rsquo;. Tries to gammon
his old mother, but I guess the old lady
knows....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;... he&rsquo;ll never....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, poor fellow. Wonderful pluck. Tells me he&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>plannin&rsquo; a cathedral ... a cathedral, mark you ...
and stone blind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally sighed a little and turned again to look at
Jim. Aunt Gerty laid a white-gloved hand gently on
the Mayor&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;Ten minutes to eleven, Josiah.
Won&rsquo;t do to be late&mdash;<i>you</i> of all people. Will it
Maria?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="LIII">LIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ARIA and Aunt Gerty, carrying respectability
to the verge of fashion, led the way by the path
across the green to the village church. Josiah, walking
with his daughters, followed ten paces behind.
Wearing the tall hat of public life he looked imposing,
but four and a quarter years of war had chastened
him. The roll and the swagger were not what they
were; four and a quarter years of incessant but fruitful
labor for the common weal had molded his mind,
had modified an aggressive personality.</p>

<p>The church, although in excess of the local requirements
as a rule, was very full this morning in November.
It was an hour of Thanksgiving. The goal
had been reached. Victory, complete and final, had
come almost like a thief in the night. And its coming
had revealed, in a manner transcending even the
awful dramas of old, the omnipotence of the moral
law. Yet again the God of Righteousness had declared
Himself in Sovereign power.</p>

<p>Grim perils had been surmounted by the devotion
of the sons and daughters of the race, but very much
remained to do. Behind the humble gratitude to the
Giver of Victory, behind the sense of exultation so
rightly uppermost this Sabbath morning, was in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>heart a desolating sense of the cost in human lives and
a deep anxiety for the future.</p>

<p>The Vicar of the parish, by name the Reverend Corfield
Stanning, was a white-haired man who had given
soul and kin freely to the Cause. He was a son of
the soil, a type of the almost extinct squarson who
survives here and there in England, half landowner,
half patriarch, less a scholar than a sportsman and a
man of the world. For that reason, perhaps, he had
the practical wisdom that books do not give. He had
the instinct for affairs which men of his type seldom
lack.</p>

<p>Victory was with the arms of Right. The people
did well to rejoice. But also it was a time for prayer,
for steadfast dedication to the gigantic tasks ahead.
The man-eating tiger was in the net. It now remained
to repair the havoc he had wrought, and to provide
security for generations unborn against his kind.</p>

<p>Having humbly thanked the Giver, the old man
prayed for his country and for those noble races of
which it was the foster-mother. He prayed for all
her wide-flung peoples to whom the Keys had been
given; he prayed that the Pioneers of sacred liberties
so long in peril, those one in name and in blood over
all the wide seas, who hold Milton&rsquo;s faith, who speak
Shakespeare&rsquo;s tongue may ever stand as now, shoulder
to shoulder in the gate.</p>

<p>He prayed for all those children of men grown old
and weak in bondage, whose chains had at last been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>cast off. He besought the Divine grace to guide
them.</p>

<p>Finally, he prayed for the Co-trustees of the future
and that the Divine wisdom encompass them in their
reckoning with a cruel and unworthy foe. He asked
that mercy be extended to those who had denied it
to others, not that it was in his heart to pity them in
their eclipse or to spare them aught of their desert,
but that the name of the Master be served, in whom
lay the ultimate hope of the world, might be honored
in mankind&rsquo;s supreme yet most terrible hour.</p>

<p>When the old man came to his brief and simple
sermon the words of his text pierced every heart.
&ldquo;Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down
his life for his friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It began with commemoration of a humble hero,
known to many in that church, who had given all he
had to give without stint or question. And he read a
letter written from the sacred and recovered soil of
France by the officer commanding that Band of Brothers
raised in their midst to the wife of one Sergeant
William Hollis, who had died a soldier and a gentleman
that his faith and his friends might live.</p>
